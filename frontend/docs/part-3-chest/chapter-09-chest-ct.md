## 22.1 Indications for Chest CT

### When Chest X-Ray Is Not Enough

CT provides superior resolution, 3D reconstruction, and characterization of lesions not visible or well-characterized on plain radiography.

### Key Indications for Chest CT

| Clinical Scenario | Why CT? |
|------------------|---------|
| Pulmonary embolism | CTPA is gold standard |
| Lung cancer evaluation | Staging, nodule characterization |
| Pulmonary nodule follow-up | Precise size measurement |
| ILD evaluation | HRCT provides pattern diagnosis |
| Mediastinal mass | Characterization and staging |
| Pleural disease | Characterization, guide drainage |
| Aortic pathology | Aneurysm, dissection |
| Chest trauma | Aortic injury, pneumothorax, hemothorax |
| Pre-surgical planning | Anatomical assessment |
| CXR abnormality — further evaluation | When CXR is abnormal but not diagnostic |

### CT Protocols

**Without contrast:**
- Pulmonary nodule evaluation
- HRCT for ILD
- Low-dose CT for lung cancer screening
- Non-vascular mediastinal evaluation

**With IV contrast:**
- Mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy characterization
- Pleural/chest wall masses
- Vascular lesions

**CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):**
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pulmonary artery anatomy
- Requires high flow rate and timing (see section 22.2)

## 22.2 CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)

### Indication

Primary imaging for **suspected pulmonary embolism (PE)**.

### Pre-Test Probability Assessment

**Wells Score for PE:**
- Calculate clinical pre-test probability
- Low probability + negative D-dimer → NO CTPA needed
- High probability → proceed to CTPA regardless of D-dimer

### CTPA Technique

**Patient preparation:**
- IV access (18G or larger antecubital)
- No premedication needed unless contrast allergy

**Contrast injection:**
- High flow rate: 4–5 mL/s
- Volume: ~100 mL
- Bolus tracking or empirical timing to pulmonary arterial phase

**Timing:**
- Must image in pulmonary arterial phase (15-20 seconds after injection)
- Too early: arteries not opacified
- Too late: veins opacify, mixing artifact in right heart

**Technique:**
- Thin slices: 1–1.5 mm (allows multiplanar reconstruction)
- Breath-hold during scan

### CTPA Interpretation — Pulmonary Embolism

**Direct signs of PE:**
- **Filling defect** within pulmonary artery — clot appears as filling defect (darker) within bright contrast
- **"Polo mint" sign:** Round filling defect surrounded by contrast (central embolus)
- **"Rail road track" sign:** Linear filling defect parallel to vessel wall (saddle embolus)
- **Vessel cutoff:** Abrupt termination of contrast-filled vessel

**Indirect signs of PE:**
- Pleural-based wedge-shaped infarct ("Hampton's hump")
- Oligemia distal to the clot (Westermark sign equivalent on CT)
- Right heart strain: RV >LV diameter ratio; D-shaped septum
- Atelectasis (subsegmental)

**Saddle PE:** Large embolus straddling the pulmonary artery bifurcation — life-threatening

### CT for Chronic Pulmonary Embolism (CTEPH)

Chronic PE organizing into the vessel wall:
- Eccentric filling defects (not central)
- Mural thickening
- Web-like defects
- Mosaic attenuation (air trapping in areas distal to obstructed vessels)
- Pulmonary artery enlargement
- Right heart enlargement

## 22.3 CT-Guided Lung Biopsy

### Indications

- Pulmonary nodule or mass requiring tissue diagnosis
- Lesion not accessible by bronchoscopy (peripheral nodules)
- Mediastinal mass biopsy
- Pleural lesion sampling

### Procedure

**Pre-procedure:**
- Coagulation check (INR &lt;1.5, platelets >50,000)
- Stop anticoagulants
- Review CT for safest approach (avoid vessels, bullae, fissures)
- Explain procedure and obtain consent

**Technique:**
1. Patient positioned for optimal approach (supine, prone, lateral)
2. CT scout and planning images
3. Local anaesthetic to skin and pleura (lidocaine)
4. Coaxial core biopsy needle inserted under CT guidance
5. Multiple cores obtained (2-4 cores typically)
6. Immediate post-procedure CT: assess for pneumothorax

**Needle types:**
- Core biopsy (18G): histology specimen (preferred for most diagnoses)
- Fine needle aspiration (FNAC, 20-22G): cytology only (less material)

### Complications

| Complication | Incidence | Management |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Pneumothorax | 20-35% (clinical ~5%) | Observation if small; chest tube if large/symptomatic |
| Pulmonary hemorrhage | 1-10% | Usually self-limited |
| Hemoptysis | 1-5% | Usually minor; rarely significant |
| Air embolism | &lt;1% | Position patient (left lateral decubitus); emergency management |

**Risk factors for pneumothorax:**
- Deeper lesions
- Traversing more lung
- Emphysema
- Multiple passes

### CT Fluoroscopy / Real-Time CT Guidance

- Near real-time CT images during needle manipulation
- Allows precise positioning of needle
- Used for deep or difficult lesions

## 22.4 Lung Cancer Staging with CT and PET-CT

### TNM Staging System (8th Edition, 2017)

**T (Primary Tumor):**
- T1: &lt;3 cm (T1a &lt;1 cm, T1b 1–2 cm, T1c 2–3 cm)
- T2: 3–5 cm or visceral pleural invasion or atelectasis/pneumonitis
- T3: 5–7 cm or chest wall, pericardium, or diaphragm invasion
- T4: >7 cm or invasion of mediastinum, heart, great vessels, carina; separate tumor lobe

**N (Regional Lymph Nodes):**
- N0: No node involvement
- N1: Ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar nodes
- N2: Ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal nodes
- N3: Contralateral mediastinal/hilar or supraclavicular nodes

**M (Metastases):**
- M0: No distant metastases
- M1a: Contralateral lung nodule; pleural/pericardial effusion
- M1b: Single extrathoracic metastasis
- M1c: Multiple extrathoracic metastases

**Stage Groupings:**
- Stage I: T1-2, N0 → Potentially curative (surgery)
- Stage II: T1-2, N1 or T3, N0 → Surgery ± chemo
- Stage III: N2-3 or T4 → Multimodality (chemo/RT)
- Stage IV: M1 → Palliative

### CT for Lung Cancer Staging

**Chest CT (with contrast):**
- Primary tumor: size, location, extent of local invasion
- Mediastinal lymph nodes: short-axis diameter >1 cm = suspicious (but non-specific)
- Pleural involvement
- Contralateral lung nodules

**Limitations of CT for mediastinal staging:**
- Sensitivity ~60%, specificity ~77% for mediastinal node involvement
- Size alone is insufficient: normal-sized nodes may be positive; enlarged nodes may be reactive

**CT Abdomen/Pelvis:**
- Adrenal glands (common site for metastases)
- Liver metastases
- CT brain (or MRI brain) for stage III-IV or SCLC

### PET-CT in Lung Cancer

**How PET works:**
- FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) is a glucose analog
- Metabolically active cells (cancer, inflammation) accumulate FDG
- Detected as areas of high "SUV" (standardized uptake value)
- SUV >2.5 generally suspicious for malignancy

**PET-CT advantages:**
- More accurate mediastinal staging than CT alone
- Detects unsuspected distant metastases in ~15% of patients staged locally by CT alone
- Avoids futile surgery in patients with undetected M1 disease
- Guides mediastinoscopy (biopsy of suspicious nodes only)

**PET-CT limitations:**
- False positives: active TB, sarcoidosis, post-radiation, inflammatory nodes
- False negatives: small lesions (&lt;1 cm), ground-glass nodules (low metabolic activity), well-differentiated tumors (carcinoid), mucinous adenocarcinoma

## 22.5 Mediastinal CT Evaluation

### Normal Mediastinal Structures

**Vascular:**
- Superior vena cava (SVC): right of trachea
- Aortic arch: left of trachea
- Main pulmonary artery: anterior to ascending aorta
- Normal lymph nodes: short axis &lt;1 cm

**Airways:**
- Trachea: midline; carina at T4-T5 level; carina angle 55-70°
- Right mainstem bronchus: more vertical, shorter (aspiration goes right)
- Left mainstem bronchus: more horizontal, longer

**Esophagus:** Posterior mediastinum; should not be dilated

### Mediastinal Lymph Node Stations (ATS Map)

Used in staging lung cancer:
- Station 1: Highest mediastinal
- Station 2: Upper paratracheal
- Station 4: Lower paratracheal
- Station 5: Subaortic (aortopulmonary window)
- Station 7: Subcarinal
- Station 10: Hilar
- Station 11: Interlobar

**N2 disease:** Ipsilateral mediastinal (stations 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) or subcarinal (7)
**N3 disease:** Contralateral mediastinal or any supraclavicular (station 1)

### Mediastinal CT Assessment Checklist

1. **Lymph nodes:** Size, location, enhancement, calcification
2. **Vascular structures:** Aorta, SVC, pulmonary arteries — normal caliber and enhancement
3. **Airways:** Trachea and bronchi — normal caliber, no extrinsic compression
4. **Esophagus:** Normal caliber; no thickening
5. **Mass lesions:** Location, attenuation, enhancement, adjacent structure invasion
6. **Pericardium:** Thickness, fluid

## Key Points Summary

1. **CTPA** is the gold standard for PE diagnosis; must be timed to pulmonary arterial phase; requires adequate contrast flow rate

2. **Wells Score** guides pre-test probability; low probability + negative D-dimer → no CTPA needed

3. **CT-guided lung biopsy** — coaxial core biopsy preferred; pneumothorax is the most common complication (20-35%)

4. **TNM staging** — CT primary tumor assessment + mediastinal nodes + PET-CT for metabolic staging

5. **PET-CT** detects unsuspected metastases in ~15% and is essential for accurate mediastinal staging; SUV >2.5 is suspicious

6. **Lung cancer types by location:** Central = squamous/SCLC; Peripheral = adenocarcinoma; Apex = Pancoast
