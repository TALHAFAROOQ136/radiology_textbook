# Chapter 21: Pulmonary Nodules and Masses

## Learning Objectives

- Define pulmonary nodule and mass and classify by size
- Evaluate solitary pulmonary nodules using Fleischner Society guidelines
- Distinguish benign from malignant radiographic features
- Describe lung cancer types and their imaging patterns
- Explain CT follow-up protocols for pulmonary nodules

## 21.1 Definitions and Classification

### Pulmonary Nodule vs. Mass

| Term | Size | Definition |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Nodule** | &lt;3 cm | Rounded opacity surrounded by lung parenchyma |
| **Mass** | ≥3 cm | Rounded opacity ≥3 cm — more likely malignant |
| **Micronodule** | &lt;3 mm | Tiny nodule |
| **Miliary** | 1-3 mm | Innumerable small nodules throughout lungs |

### By Density (CT Classification)

**Solid nodule:** Complete soft tissue attenuation; vessels and bronchi cannot be seen through it

**Ground-glass nodule (GGN / pure GGO nodule):**
- Increased attenuation that does NOT obscure vessels
- Hazy, less opaque than solid
- Higher risk of slow-growing adenocarcinoma spectrum (AAH, AIS, MIA, invasive adenocarcinoma)

**Part-solid nodule (subsolid):**
- Contains both GGO and solid components
- Solid component more likely malignant
- Highest risk for lung cancer among nodule subtypes

## 21.2 Solitary Pulmonary Nodule (SPN) Evaluation

### Prevalence and Malignancy Risk

- ~0.1–2% of chest X-rays show a nodule
- CT detects nodules in ~50% of adult smokers
- Overall malignancy risk of SPN: 5–40% (depends on patient risk factors and nodule characteristics)

### Features Suggesting Benignity

**Calcification patterns (benign):**
- **Central (bull's eye):** Typical of granuloma (histoplasmosis, TB)
- **Laminated (ring-like):** Granuloma
- **Diffuse:** Granuloma, hamartoma
- **"Popcorn":** Classic for pulmonary hamartoma (chondroid calcification)

**Stability:**
- No change in size over 2 years = benign (rule of thumb)
- Exception: slow-growing adenocarcinomas (GGN) may grow imperceptibly over years

**Shape and margins:** Smooth, well-defined margin — more likely benign (though not definitive)

### Features Suggesting Malignancy

- **Spiculated margin** ("corona radiata"): Radiating lines from nodule into lung — most suspicious for malignancy
- **Lobulated margin:** Uneven growth pattern — moderately suspicious
- **Irregular/asymmetric calcification:** Does not fit benign patterns
- **Pleural tethering:** Linear strand from nodule to pleura
- **Satellite nodules:** Small nodules around the main nodule
- **Cavitation with thick, irregular walls:** Squamous cell carcinoma; occasionally adenocarcinoma
- **Growth:** Any growth on follow-up is suspicious; doubling time 20–300 days for most malignancies

### Probability Assessment Tools

**Probability models used clinically:**
- Mayo Clinic model (Swensen formula)
- Brock University model
- Lung-RADS for screening CT

**Clinical risk factors for malignancy:**
- Older age
- Smoking history
- Prior malignancy
- Family history of lung cancer
- Upper lobe location
- Larger nodule size

## 21.3 Fleischner Society Guidelines (2017)

### For Incidental Solid Nodules in Adults ≥35 years

**Low-risk patients** (no major risk factors: non-smoker, no prior cancer, no family history)

| Size | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|
| &lt;6 mm | No follow-up needed |
| 6–8 mm | CT at 6–12 months; then consider 18–24 months |
| &gt;8 mm | CT at 3 months, PET-CT, or tissue sampling |

**High-risk patients** (smoker, prior cancer, or other risk factors)

| Size | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|
| &lt;6 mm | CT at 12 months (optional) |
| 6–8 mm | CT at 6–12 months; then 18–24 months |
| &gt;8 mm | CT at 3 months, PET-CT, or tissue sampling |

### For Ground-Glass Nodules (GGN) and Part-Solid Nodules

**Pure GGN:**
- &lt;6 mm: No follow-up needed
- ≥6 mm: CT at 6–12 months; if stable, every 2 years for 5 years

**Part-solid nodule:**
- &lt;6 mm total: No follow-up needed
- ≥6 mm: CT at 3–6 months; if solid component develops or grows → further workup
- **Solid component >6 mm is suspicious → more aggressive evaluation**

### Multiple Nodules

- Follow highest-risk nodule
- Multiple small bilateral nodules suggest metastatic disease (especially with known malignancy)
- Multiple GGN: may represent multifocal adenocarcinoma

## 21.4 Multiple Pulmonary Nodules

### Causes of Multiple Nodules

**Metastatic disease (most common cause of multiple nodules):**
- Common primaries: colorectal, breast, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, thyroid, sarcoma
- Characteristics: well-defined, variable size, basal/peripheral predominance, bilateral
- "Cannonball metastases": large rounded metastases (renal cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma)

**Granulomatous disease:**
- Old TB, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis
- Calcified; stable

**Septic emboli:**
- Multiple bilateral nodules with cavitation
- Peripheral distribution
- IVDU, right-sided endocarditis, septic thrombophlebitis

**Sarcoidosis:**
- Perilymphatic distribution on HRCT
- Associated hilar lymphadenopathy

**Wegener's Granulomatosis (GPA):**
- Multiple bilateral nodules, often cavitating
- Upper lobe predominance
- Associated with sinusitis and renal disease

**Lymphoma:**
- Multiple pulmonary nodules ± consolidation
- Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy often present

## 21.5 Lung Cancer Imaging

### Types and Radiographic Patterns

**Adenocarcinoma (most common type ~40%):**
- Can appear as: GGN, part-solid nodule, solid nodule, consolidation ("mimics pneumonia")
- Peripheral location
- May have bronchioloalveolar growth pattern (spreading along alveolar walls)
- Lepidic adenocarcinoma: GGO pattern; consolidation = invasive component

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (~25%):**
- Central/hilar location (arising from mainstem bronchi)
- Cavitation common (thick-walled, irregular)
- Associated with obstructive collapse/pneumonia distally
- Perihilar mass with distal atelectasis

**Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) (~15%):**
- Central location
- Rapid growth — presents late
- Bulky mediastinal/hilar adenopathy
- Paraneoplastic syndromes (SIADH, Cushing's syndrome, Lambert-Eaton)
- Associated with smoking

**Large Cell Carcinoma (~10%):**
- Large peripheral mass
- Often heterogeneous (necrosis)
- No specific imaging features (diagnosis by exclusion)

### Lung Cancer Staging

**TNM staging:** T (tumor), N (nodes), M (metastases)

**CT for staging:**
- Primary tumor size and local extent
- Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (short axis >1 cm = suspicious)
- Distant metastases

**PET-CT:**
- Metabolic activity of lymph nodes (highly sensitive for mediastinal staging)
- Detection of distant metastases
- Essential for curative intent staging

**Brain MRI:**
- Staging for NSCLC stage III-IV; SCLC (high brain metastasis risk)

### Complications of Central Lung Cancer

**Obstructive pneumonia:**
- Distal to airway obstruction
- Segmental or lobar distribution
- Recurrent pneumonia in same lobe → ALWAYS investigate for central lesion

**Atelectasis:**
- Complete lobar collapse distal to central obstruction
- "Golden S" sign: reverse S-shape of the minor fissure with right upper lobe collapse around a central hilar mass

**Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome:**
- Venous obstruction from right-sided tumor or adenopathy
- CT venography or CTA to assess

**Pancoast Tumor (Superior Sulcus Tumor):**
- Apex of lung → invades brachial plexus, sympathetic chain, ribs, vertebrae
- Horner's syndrome: ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis (sympathetic chain involvement)
- Brachial plexopathy: shoulder/arm pain
- CXR: Apical opacification; rib destruction
- MRI superior to CT for local invasion

## Key Points Summary

1. **Nodule &lt;3 cm; mass ≥3 cm** — mass is more likely malignant

2. **Benign calcification patterns:** Central, laminated, diffuse, popcorn — suggest granuloma or hamartoma

3. **Spiculated margin** = most suspicious for malignancy (Corona radiata sign)

4. **Fleischner guidelines:** Nodules &lt;6 mm in low-risk patients don't need follow-up; solid component in part-solid nodule is the key risk factor

5. **Multiple pulmonary nodules** — metastases are most common cause in cancer patients; septic emboli in IVDU

6. **Squamous cell carcinoma** — central, cavitating; adenocarcinoma — peripheral, GGO/solid; SCLC — central, bulky mediastinal disease

7. **Obstructive pneumonia** — recurrent pneumonia in same location → always rule out central lung cancer
