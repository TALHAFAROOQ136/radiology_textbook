# Chapter 15: Approach to Reading Chest X-Rays

## Systematic interpretation checklist

When interpreting chest X-rays, following a systematic approach ensures that no important findings are missed. A commonly used method is the ABCDE approach:

- **A** - Airways: Check tracheal position, carina, main bronchi
- **B** - Breathing: Examine lungs for consolidation, masses, pneumothorax, pleural effusion
- **C** - Circulation: Assess heart size, mediastinal contours, great vessels
- **D** - Diaphragm: Look at hemidiaphragm positions, costophrenic angles
- **E** - Everything else: Bones, soft tissues, foreign objects, technical quality

## Comparing with previous images

Always compare with prior studies when available:

- Identify interval changes
- Assess stability of known findings
- Confirm presence of chronic changes
- Evaluate response to treatment

## Technical factors: rotation, inspiration, penetration

### Rotation Assessment
- Spinous processes should align with the center of the vertebral bodies
- Equal distance between the medial clavicular heads and the spinous processes of T4-T5

### Inspiration Adequacy
- At least 6 anterior ribs should be visible at the level of the diaphragmatic domes
- Poor inspiration can mimic pulmonary edema or consolidation

### Penetration Quality
- Adequate: Vertebral bodies should be faintly visible through the cardiac silhouette
- Underpenetrated: Cannot see vertebral bodies, may miss pulmonary pathology
- Overpenetrated: May lose lung markings detail

## Common artifacts and pitfalls

- Clothing artifacts (buttons, jewelry, zippers)
- Monitoring equipment (pacemakers, catheters, tubes)
- Skin folds mimicking pneumothorax
- Breast shadows obscuring lower lung zones
- Motion blur from patient movement
- Portable technique limitations

## Lateral chest X-ray interpretation

The lateral view complements the posteroanterior (PA) view:

- Assess retrosternal space (normally >5mm in adults)
- Evaluate retrocardiac area (lung markings should be visible)
- Identify lesions hidden in the AP view
- Determine anatomical location (anterior, middle, posterior mediastinum)
- Assess for subtle pneumothoraces that may not be visible on the PA view
