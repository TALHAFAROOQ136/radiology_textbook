# Chest Physiology in Radiology

Understanding chest physiology is fundamental to interpreting chest radiographs and recognizing pathological changes. The chest contains vital organs and structures that work in harmony to maintain respiratory and cardiovascular function.

## Respiratory Physiology

### Lung Structure and Function

The lungs are composed of intricate structures that facilitate gas exchange:

- **Alveoli**: Tiny air sacs where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs
- **Alveolar-capillary membrane**: Thin barrier (0.2-0.5 μm) allowing efficient gas exchange
- **Pulmonary surfactant**: Lipoprotein complex reducing surface tension and preventing alveolar collapse
- **Lung volumes**: Tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, and residual volume

### Ventilation and Perfusion

- **Ventilation (V)**: Airflow into and out of alveoli
- **Perfusion (Q)**: Blood flow through pulmonary capillaries
- **V/Q matching**: Optimal gas exchange requires balanced ventilation and perfusion
- **Regional differences**: Gravity affects both ventilation and perfusion distribution

### Gas Exchange Mechanisms

- **Diffusion capacity**: Ability of lungs to transfer gases across alveolar-capillary membrane
- **Oxygen transport**: Binding to hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma
- **Carbon dioxide transport**: Bicarbonate formation, carbamino compounds, and dissolved form
- **Bohr and Haldane effects**: Physiological mechanisms optimizing gas transport

## Cardiovascular Physiology

### Heart Structure and Function

The heart pumps blood through pulmonary and systemic circulation:

- **Right heart**: Receives deoxygenated blood and pumps to lungs
- **Left heart**: Receives oxygenated blood and pumps to systemic circulation
- **Cardiac cycle**: Systole and diastole phases coordinating atrial and ventricular function
- **Coronary circulation**: Supplies oxygen and nutrients to myocardium

### Pulmonary Circulation

- **Low pressure system**: Pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins operate at low pressure
- **Pulmonary vascular resistance**: Much lower than systemic circulation
- **Capillary bed**: Extensive network surrounding alveoli for gas exchange
- **Regulation**: Responds to hypoxia with vasoconstriction to optimize V/Q matching

## Normal Chest Anatomy on Radiographs

### Mediastinal Structures

- **Superior mediastinum**: Contains great vessels, thymus, and upper trachea
- **Middle mediastinum**: Contains heart, main bronchi, and ascending/descending aorta
- **Posterior mediastinum**: Contains descending aorta, esophagus, and thoracic duct
- **Anterior mediastinum**: Contains thymus and fat

### Diaphragmatic Anatomy

- **Right hemidiaphragm**: Elevated by liver, usually 1-2 cm higher than left
- **Left hemidiaphragm**: Elevated by gastric air bubble
- **Crura**: Posterior attachments to vertebral bodies
- **Costophrenic angles**: Lateral angles where diaphragm meets chest wall

### Pulmonary Vasculature

- **Pulmonary arteries**: Carry deoxygenated blood from right ventricle
- **Pulmonary veins**: Carry oxygenated blood to left atrium
- **Bronchial circulation**: Systemic circulation supplying lung parenchyma
- **Distribution**: Arteries follow bronchi, veins run between segments

## Respiratory Mechanics

### Breathing Process

- **Inspiration**: Active process involving diaphragm and external intercostal muscles
- **Expiration**: Passive process during quiet breathing, active during forced expiration
- **Pressure changes**: Negative intrapleural pressure maintains lung inflation
- **Lung compliance**: Distensibility of lungs affecting breathing effort

### Control of Breathing

- **Central chemoreceptors**: Respond to CO₂ and pH changes in cerebrospinal fluid
- **Peripheral chemoreceptors**: Respond to O₂, CO₂, and pH in carotid and aortic bodies
- **Respiratory centers**: Medullary and pontine centers controlling rhythm
- **Reflexes**: Hering-Breuer reflex and other protective mechanisms

## Normal Variants and Anatomical Considerations

### Age-Related Changes

- **Infant chest**: More horizontal ribs, larger thymus, different cardiothoracic ratio
- **Adult chest**: Mature anatomy with established landmarks
- **Elderly chest**: Potential changes in diaphragmatic position, rib calcifications
- **Developmental variants**: Anatomical differences affecting radiographic appearance

### Positional Effects

- **Supine vs. upright**: Diaphragmatic position, vascular redistribution, fluid collection patterns
- **Left lateral decubitus**: Helps identify small pleural effusions
- **Expiration**: Smaller lung volumes, crowded vessels, elevated diaphragms
- **Deep inspiration**: Larger lung volumes, flattened diaphragms, clear vascular markings

## Physiological Adaptations

### Exercise Responses

- **Increased cardiac output**: Higher stroke volume and heart rate
- **Enhanced ventilation**: Increased tidal volume and respiratory rate
- **Vasodilation**: In active muscles, increased perfusion
- **Oxygen extraction**: Enhanced tissue oxygen utilization

### Altitude Adaptations

- **Hypoxic ventilatory response**: Increased ventilation at altitude
- **Erythropoietin release**: Stimulates red blood cell production
- **Cellular adaptations**: Enhanced oxygen utilization
- **Pulmonary vasoconstriction**: May lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema

## Clinical Correlations

### Physiological Parameters in Disease

- **Restrictive lung disease**: Reduced lung volumes and capacities
- **Obstructive lung disease**: Impaired airflow with preserved volumes
- **V/Q mismatch**: Ventilation-perfusion abnormalities causing hypoxemia
- **Shunt physiology**: Perfusion without adequate ventilation

### Radiographic Manifestations of Physiological Changes

- **Hyperinflation**: Increased lung volumes, flattened diaphragms, increased retrosternal airspace
- **Atelectasis**: Decreased lung volumes, shifted fissures, elevated hemidiaphragm
- **Pulmonary edema**: Fluid accumulation affecting gas exchange
- **Pneumothorax**: Air in pleural space disrupting normal mechanics

Understanding chest physiology is essential for recognizing normal radiographic appearances and identifying pathological changes that affect respiratory and cardiovascular function. This knowledge guides accurate interpretation of chest radiographs and helps identify disease processes affecting the thoracic organs.
