## 17.1 Interstitial Patterns

### What Is the Interstitium?

The pulmonary interstitium is the structural framework of the lung that includes:
- The alveolar walls (septa)
- Peribronchovascular sheaths
- Interlobular septa
- Subpleural tissue

When the interstitium is abnormal, it shows characteristic patterns on imaging.

### Reticular Pattern

**Definition:** Network of fine lines intersecting to form a mesh

**Mechanism:** Thickened interlobular septa or intralobular fibrosis

**Subtypes:**
- **Fine reticulation:** Early or mild ILD; fine mesh
- **Coarse reticulation:** Advanced fibrosis; larger mesh
- **Honeycombing:** End-stage fibrosis; air-containing cysts in clusters (like a honeycomb); strongly suggests UIP pattern (IPF)

**Distribution:**
- Basal predominant: IPF, asbestosis
- Upper lobe: sarcoidosis, HP (chronic), silicosis
- Diffuse: connective tissue disease ILD

### Nodular Pattern

**Definition:** Discrete nodules of similar size distributed in the lung

**Types by distribution:**
| Distribution | Characteristics | Common Causes |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Centrilobular** | Clustered; near center of secondary lobule; spares pleura | HP, respiratory bronchiolitis |
| **Perilymphatic** | Along lymphatics (subpleural, peribronchovascular, septal) | Sarcoidosis, silicosis |
| **Random** | No pattern; uniformly distributed | Miliary TB, hematogenous metastases |

### Reticulonodular Pattern

Combination of reticular lines and nodules — seen in many ILDs including:
- Sarcoidosis
- Silicosis
- Early IPF

### Ground-Glass Opacity (GGO)

- Increased lung density that does NOT obscure vessels
- Indicates partial filling of alveolar spaces or thickening of alveolar walls
- Active (potentially reversible): inflammation, edema
- Can indicate active alveolitis in ILD — more responsive to treatment
- CT is essential for proper characterization

## 17.2 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

### Definition

IPF is a chronic, progressive fibrosing ILD of unknown cause with a Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT or histology.

### Clinical Features

- Age >60; more common in men
- Smokers > non-smokers
- Progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough
- Bibasal Velcro-like crackles on auscultation
- Clubbing (30-40%)
- Poor prognosis: median survival 3-5 years from diagnosis

### Chest X-Ray Features

- **Bilateral basal reticular opacities**
- Peripheral distribution
- Reduced lung volumes (fibrosis = restrictive disease)
- Honeycombing visible in advanced cases
- May appear normal in early disease

### HRCT Features — UIP Pattern

HRCT is the gold standard for IPF diagnosis (often avoids surgical lung biopsy):

**Definite UIP pattern (diagnostic of IPF in right clinical context):**
- **Honeycombing** — subpleural, basal-dominant; clusters of air-containing cysts
- **Basal predominant** fibrosis
- **Peripheral predominant** fibrosis (subpleural)
- Traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis within fibrosis
- Minimal or no GGO

**Features suggesting alternative diagnosis (not IPF):**
- Upper or peribronchovascular predominance
- Extensive GGO without reticulation
- Nodules (bilateral, upper lobe)
- Air trapping

### ATS/ERS Diagnostic Criteria Summary

Diagnosis of IPF requires:
1. Exclusion of other known causes of ILD
2. UIP pattern on HRCT
3. If HRCT not definitive: surgical lung biopsy showing UIP histology

## 17.3 Sarcoidosis

### Overview

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are affected in >90% of patients.

### Scadding Stages (Chest X-Ray Based)

| Stage | Description | Spontaneous Remission |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Stage 0 | Normal chest X-ray | — |
| Stage 1 | Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) only | 55-90% |
| Stage 2 | BHL + pulmonary infiltrates | 40-70% |
| Stage 3 | Pulmonary infiltrates only (no adenopathy) | 10-20% |
| Stage 4 | Advanced fibrosis | &lt;5% |

**Stage 1 is the most common presentation.**

### Chest X-Ray Features

**Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL):**
- Symmetric, bilateral
- "Potato nodes" — lobulated hilar masses
- "Pawnbroker sign" — bilateral hilar enlargement with right paratracheal adenopathy (1-2-3 pattern on right: right paratracheal, right hilar, left hilar)
- Usually bilateral (unilateral should prompt alternative diagnosis — TB, lymphoma)

**Pulmonary infiltrates:**
- Reticulonodular pattern
- Upper and middle lobe distribution
- Perilymphatic distribution: subpleural, peribronchovascular, along fissures

### HRCT Features

- **Perilymphatic nodules** (diagnostic when classic): bilateral, upper/middle lobe, subpleural, peribronchovascular, septal
- "Galaxy sign": central mass of coalescing nodules with peripheral satellite nodules
- Air-space consolidation (alveolar sarcoidosis)
- Fibrosis: traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing in stage 4

### Extra-Pulmonary Manifestations

- Skin: erythema nodosum (common, benign), lupus pernio
- Eyes: uveitis (5-25%)
- Cardiac: arrhythmias, heart block, sudden death
- Neurological: cranial nerve palsies, meningitis
- Liver, spleen: hepatosplenomegaly

## 17.4 Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)

### Definition

HP (Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis) is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by repeated inhalation of organic antigens in sensitized individuals.

### Common Causative Antigens

| Antigen Source | Disease Name |
|---------------|-------------|
| Bird droppings (pigeon, budgerigar) | Bird fancier's lung |
| Thermophilic bacteria in moldy hay | Farmer's lung |
| Thermophilic bacteria in contaminated water/humidifiers | Humidifier lung |
| Aspergillus fumigatus | Malt worker's lung |
| Mycobacteria in water (hot tubs) | Hot tub lung |

### Clinical Phases

**Acute HP (4-8 hours after exposure):**
- Fever, chills, myalgia, dyspnea
- Resolves within days of antigen avoidance
- Recurs on re-exposure

**Subacute HP:**
- Gradually worsening dyspnea
- Insidious onset

**Chronic HP:**
- Progressive fibrosis
- Often indistinguishable from IPF clinically
- Antigen history crucial for diagnosis

### Chest X-Ray

- Acute: Bilateral fine nodular or ground-glass opacities; lower/middle zone
- Subacute: Reticulonodular pattern
- Chronic: Fibrosis; may resemble IPF

### HRCT Features

**Acute/Subacute HP:**
- Centrilobular nodules (ill-defined, GGO halo)
- Ground-glass opacity
- Air trapping (mosaic attenuation) on expiratory CT — bilateral, patchy
- Upper/middle lobe predominance

**Chronic HP:**
- Fibrosis: traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing
- Subpleural distribution (but less exclusively basal than IPF)
- Mixed with GGO and air trapping
- Can mimic IPF or NSIP

**"Head cheese" sign:** Mixed areas of consolidation/GGO, normal lung, and air trapping — characteristic of HP

## 17.5 High-Resolution CT (HRCT) in ILD

### Why HRCT?

HRCT provides exquisite detail of lung architecture that is not visible on chest X-ray.

**Advantages over CXR:**
- Detects ILD when CXR is normal
- Characterizes pattern (UIP, NSIP, HP, sarcoidosis)
- Guides biopsy site selection
- Monitors disease progression
- Avoids surgical lung biopsy in many cases

### HRCT Technique

- **1-mm slices** (high resolution)
- Reconstruction using **high-frequency (bone) algorithm** — maximizes spatial resolution
- Prone images: helpful to distinguish true fibrosis from dependent atelectasis (positional GGO)
- Expiratory images: detect air trapping (HP, constrictive bronchiolitis)
- No contrast required

### Key HRCT Patterns for Common ILDs

| Pattern | HRCT Features | Likely Diagnosis |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| UIP | Honeycombing, basal-peripheral reticulation, traction bronchiectasis | IPF |
| NSIP | Bilateral GGO, basal reticulation, subpleural sparing | Connective tissue ILD, HP |
| Perilymphatic nodules | Subpleural, peribronchovascular, septal nodules | Sarcoidosis |
| Centrilobular nodules + air trapping | Upper/mid zone, mosaic attenuation | HP |
| Crazy paving | GGO + septal thickening | Alveolar proteinosis, COVID-19 |

### Secondary Pulmonary Lobule

Understanding the secondary pulmonary lobule (smallest unit of lung structure bounded by interlobular septa):
- Centrilobular: center of lobule (airways, arteries) → centrilobular nodules
- Perilobular/Perilymphatic: edges of lobule (septa, subpleural, peribronchovascular) → sarcoidosis
- Random: no relation to lobule structure → miliary disease

---

## Key Points Summary

1. **Reticular pattern** = thickened interstitial lines; honeycombing = end-stage fibrosis (clusters of small air-containing cysts)

2. **IPF/UIP**: bibasal, peripheral, subpleural honeycombing and reticulation; minimal GGO; traction bronchiectasis — poor prognosis

3. **Sarcoidosis**: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Stage 1); perilymphatic nodules; upper/middle lobe distribution — often self-limited

4. **HP**: centrilobular nodules, GGO, and air trapping; upper/middle lobe predominance; antigen exposure history crucial

5. **HRCT**: 1 mm slices, high-frequency algorithm; can diagnose IPF without biopsy; prone and expiratory images add diagnostic value

6. **Perilymphatic vs. centrilobular nodule distribution** is the key differentiator between sarcoidosis and HP
