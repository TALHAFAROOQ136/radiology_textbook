# Chapter 19: Mediastinal and Hilar Abnormalities

## Learning Objectives

- Classify mediastinal masses by compartment location
- Identify the "4 T's" of the anterior mediastinum
- Recognize hilar lymphadenopathy and its causes
- Describe aortic pathology on chest X-ray and CT

---

## 19.1 Mediastinal Compartments

### Classification

The mediastinum is divided into compartments for localization of masses. Two major classification systems are used:

**Traditional Classification:**
- **Anterior:** Anterior to pericardium
- **Middle:** Pericardium, heart, trachea, main bronchi, hila
- **Posterior:** Behind pericardium, including esophagus, descending aorta, paravertebral regions

**International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) CT-based Classification:**
- **Prevascular (anterior):** Anterior to great vessels
- **Visceral:** Great vessels, trachea, esophagus, heart
- **Paravertebral:** Paravertebral sulci

### Why Location Matters

The compartment predicts the most likely diagnosis (differential diagnosis based on location):

| Compartment | Most Common Masses |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Anterior (Prevascular)** | Thymoma, Teratoma, Thyroid, Terrible lymphoma ("4 T's") |
| **Middle (Visceral)** | Lymphoma, bronchogenic cyst, pericardial cyst |
| **Posterior (Paravertebral)** | Neurogenic tumors, esophageal mass, aortic aneurysm |

## 19.2 Anterior Mediastinal Masses — "The 4 T's"

### 1. Thymoma

**Most common anterior mediastinal mass in adults**

**Clinical:** Often asymptomatic; associations with myasthenia gravis (30-50%), pure red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia

**Radiographic features:**
- Soft tissue mass anterior to aorta and main pulmonary artery
- Usually unilateral, may be lobulated
- May calcify (rim or central)
- Well-defined margins when encapsulated (benign-appearing)

**CT features:**
- Well-encapsulated oval/lobular anterior mediastinal mass
- Heterogeneous if large (necrosis, cysts)
- Invasion of adjacent structures indicates malignant thymoma

**Masaoka staging (surgical staging):** I-IV based on capsular and local invasion

### 2. Teratoma (Germ Cell Tumors)

**Most common GCT in mediastinum:** Mature teratoma (benign)

**Radiographic features:**
- Anterior mediastinal mass
- **CT hallmark:** Contains fat, calcium, soft tissue, and fluid components (mixed/heterogeneous)
- Fat-containing mass with calcification = highly suggestive of teratoma
- "Dermoid cyst" = mature cystic teratoma

**Malignant GCTs:**
- Seminoma: homogeneous mass; serum beta-HCG elevated
- Non-seminomatous GCT: heterogeneous; AFP and beta-HCG elevated
- Typically in young men

### 3. Thyroid (Goiter/Thyroid Mass)

- Extension of cervical goiter into superior mediastinum
- Common cause of superior mediastinal widening
- **CT:** Mass continuous with cervical thyroid; calcifications; marked enhancement (vascular supply from thyroid vessels)
- Tracheal deviation is classic
- Iodine uptake on nuclear medicine thyroid scan

### 4. Terrible Lymphoma

**Lymphoma** is the most common cause of anterior mediastinal mass in young adults and most common mediastinal mass overall

**Types:**
- Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL): anterior mediastinal mass in >50% of cases
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL): mediastinal mass less common; extranodal involvement more frequent
- **Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL):** Young women; anterior mediastinal mass; rapid growth

**Radiographic features:**
- Lobulated anterior mediastinal mass
- May be massive ("bulky disease" if >10 cm)
- Bilateral hilar enlargement often associated (HL)
- Pleural and pericardial involvement possible

**CT features:**
- Conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes
- Homogeneous or minimally heterogeneous
- Anterior mediastinal mass ± superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction

**Treatment response:**
- PET-CT is standard for staging and treatment response
- Residual mass after treatment: may be fibrosis (PET-CT distinguishes active disease from fibrosis)

---

## 19.3 Middle Mediastinal Masses

### Bronchogenic Cyst

- Foregut duplication cyst
- Located near carina (most common), mainstem bronchi
- **CT:** Well-defined, rounded, water-density (0-20 HU) or higher density (if complicated)
- Non-enhancing (no vessel within)
- May cause extrinsic compression of esophagus or bronchus

### Pericardial Cyst

- Congenital cyst containing clear fluid
- Location: right cardiophrenic angle (most common)
- **CT:** Thin-walled, water density cyst; non-enhancing
- Unilocular, no internal structure

### Lymphadenopathy (see hilar section)

---

## 19.4 Posterior Mediastinal Masses

### Neurogenic Tumors

**Most common posterior mediastinal mass** (especially in children)

**Types:**
| Type | Origin | Typical Patient |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Schwannoma | Schwann cells | Adults; benign |
| Neurofibroma | Nerve sheath | Adults; NF1 association |
| Ganglioneuroma | Ganglion cells | Older children, adults; benign |
| Neuroblastoma | Primitive neural | Children &lt;5 years; malignant |

**Radiographic features:**
- Paraspinal mass (one side of spine)
- Associated with rib erosion, widened neural foramen
- Smooth or lobulated outline
- "Dumbbell" shape: extends through neural foramen into spinal canal (MRI needed)

### Aortic Aneurysm and Pseudoaneurysm

- Descending thoracic aorta — posterior mediastinal location
- **CXR:** Left-sided mediastinal widening, curvilinear calcification
- **CTA:** Confirms aneurysm size, extent, and involvement of branch vessels

### Esophageal Masses

- Hiatal hernia (common): gas or contrast-containing structure behind heart
- Esophageal carcinoma: mediastinal invasion on CT
- Achalasia: dilated esophagus with air-fluid level

---

## 19.5 Hilar Abnormalities

### Normal Hila

- Left hilum is 0.5–1.5 cm higher than right hilum
- Left hilum is composed of the left pulmonary artery (superior hilum) and left upper lobe bronchus
- Right hilum contains right pulmonary artery (inferolateral) and right upper lobe bronchus

### Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy (BHL)

**Most common causes:**
1. **Sarcoidosis** — most common cause of BHL; bilateral and symmetric; associated with right paratracheal adenopathy ("1-2-3 sign" or "pawnbroker sign")
2. **Lymphoma** — particularly Hodgkin's; often asymmetric
3. **Primary TB** — particularly in children; often asymmetric
4. **Viral infections** — EBV (infectious mononucleosis), histoplasmosis

**Bilateral and symmetric:**
- Sarcoidosis (most likely)
- Lymphoma
- Viral (less common)

**Unilateral or asymmetric:**
- Suspect TB, malignancy, lymphoma

### Unilateral Hilar Enlargement

**Differential:**
- Lymphadenopathy (TB, metastases, lymphoma)
- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (enlarged pulmonary artery — bilateral in advanced cases)
- Lung cancer causing hilar mass

### Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)

**CXR findings:**
- Bilateral hilar enlargement (enlarged pulmonary arteries)
- "Pruning" of peripheral pulmonary vessels (periphery appears oligemic)
- Right heart enlargement (right atrium and ventricle)
- Prominent main pulmonary artery (left hilum convexity)

**CT findings:**
- Main pulmonary artery diameter >29 mm suggests PAH
- Cardiomegaly, right ventricular enlargement
- Mosaic attenuation (chronic thromboembolic PAH — CTEPH)

---

## 19.6 Aortic Pathology

### Mediastinal Widening — When to Suspect Aortic Injury?

**CXR findings suggesting aortic injury (traumatic):**
- Mediastinal widening >8 cm at level of aortic arch
- Loss of aortic knob definition
- Tracheal deviation to the right
- Left apical pleural cap (hemothorax above aortic arch)
- Depression of left mainstem bronchus >140°

**Action:** CT Angiography (CTA) if any of these signs present

### Aortic Dissection

**Classification:**
- **Stanford A:** Involves ascending aorta (requires emergency surgery)
- **Stanford B:** Involves only descending aorta (usually medical management)

**CT Angiography features:**
- **Intimal flap:** Linear or curvilinear density within aortic lumen, dividing it into true and false lumen
- **True lumen:** Smaller, enhanced earlier; contains calcified intima
- **False lumen:** Larger; may contain thrombus; "beak sign" (acute angle between flap and outer wall)
- Entry tear location: Stanford A = ascending aorta; Stanford B = just distal to subclavian artery

### Aortic Aneurysm

**Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA):**
- Ascending aorta: >4.5 cm diameter (elective repair at >5–5.5 cm)
- Descending thoracic aorta: >6 cm
- Causes: atherosclerosis, Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, inflammatory

**CXR:**
- Mediastinal widening
- Curvilinear calcification in aortic wall

**CTA:**
- Definitive measurement
- Relationship to branch vessels
- Detect complications (contained rupture, penetrating ulcer)

## Key Points Summary

1. **"4 T's"** of the anterior mediastinum: Thymoma, Teratoma, Thyroid, Terrible Lymphoma

2. **Sarcoidosis** = most common cause of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (symmetric); "pawnbroker sign" with right paratracheal adenopathy

3. **Thymoma** — most common anterior mediastinal mass in adults; associated with myasthenia gravis

4. **Fat + calcium in anterior mediastinal mass** = teratoma

5. **Posterior mediastinal mass** = neurogenic tumor until proven otherwise; assess for neural foraminal extension (MRI/CT)

6. **Aortic dissection** — CTA shows intimal flap dividing aortic lumen; Stanford A involves ascending aorta
