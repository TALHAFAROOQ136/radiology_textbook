## 18.1 Pleural Effusion

### Normal Pleural Space

The pleural space normally contains a thin film of fluid (15-20 mL) that allows frictionless lung movement. Excess fluid accumulates as a pleural effusion.

### Causes of Pleural Effusion

**Transudates (low protein &lt;3 g/dL) — hydrostatic/osmotic imbalance:**
- Congestive heart failure (most common cause)
- Cirrhosis
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Hypoalbuminemia

**Exudates (high protein >3 g/dL) — increased vascular permeability:**
- Pneumonia / parapneumonic effusion
- Malignancy (primary or metastatic)
- Pulmonary embolism
- Tuberculosis
- Pancreatitis (left-sided)
- Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE

**Light's Criteria** (distinguish transudate from exudate):
Exudate if ANY of:
- Pleural/serum protein ratio >0.5
- Pleural/serum LDH ratio >0.6
- Pleural LDH >2/3 upper limit of serum normal

### Radiographic Features

**PA Chest X-ray:**

**Small effusion (200-500 mL):**
- Blunting of costophrenic angle (most sensitive sign)
- Meniscus sign: fluid curves up along chest wall (appears as a curved density)

**Moderate effusion (500-1500 mL):**
- Opacifies lower hemithorax
- Costophrenic angle completely obscured
- Meniscus sign visible laterally

**Large effusion (>1500 mL):**
- Complete or near-complete opacification of hemithorax
- Mediastinal shift away from effusion (if no underlying collapse)
- Lung pushed toward mediastinum

**Detection thresholds:**
- Lateral CXR: detects as little as 50-75 mL
- PA CXR: detects 175-200 mL reliably (blunting of costophrenic angle)
- Ultrasound: detects as little as 5-20 mL

### Subpulmonic Effusion

Fluid collects under the lung (between lung base and diaphragm):
- Apparent elevation of hemidiaphragm
- Peak of "diaphragm" shifted laterally (right side)
- Left-sided: stomach bubble separated from "diaphragm"
- Lateral decubitus confirms — fluid layers dependently

### Loculated Effusion

Effusion trapped by adhesions:
- Fixed opacity that doesn't change position on decubitus views
- Elliptical, lenticular shape
- May be anywhere in pleural space (peripheral, fissures, interlobar)
- Ultrasound and CT best for characterization

### Fissural Fluid (Phantom Tumor / Vanishing Tumor)

- Fluid trapped in fissure
- Appears as apparent mass on PA view
- Elliptical on lateral view
- Disappears on resolution of heart failure
- Classic appearance of "phantom tumor" or "vanishing tumor"

### Ultrasound of Pleural Effusion

- Anechoic (black) — simple transudates
- Internal echoes — exudates, hemorrhage, empyema
- Septations / loculations — exudate, empyema
- Real-time visualization for guided drainage

## 18.2 Pneumothorax

### Definition

Pneumothorax = air in the pleural space, causing lung collapse.

### Causes

**Spontaneous:**
- **Primary spontaneous:** Tall, thin young men; rupture of subpleural blebs
- **Secondary spontaneous:** Underlying lung disease (COPD, cystic fibrosis, Marfan syndrome, lymphangioleiomyomatosis)

**Traumatic:**
- Blunt chest trauma (rib fracture lacerating pleura)
- Penetrating chest injury
- Iatrogenic: central line insertion, lung biopsy, thoracentesis, positive pressure ventilation

### Radiographic Features

**PA CXR:**
- White visceral pleural line visible parallel to chest wall
- Absent lung markings peripheral to the line
- Lung retracted toward mediastinum
- Best seen at apex (upright patient)

**Size estimation (BTS guidelines):**
- Small: &lt;2 cm between lung edge and chest wall at hilum level
- Large: >2 cm (approximately >50% volume)

**Expiratory CXR:**
- Pneumothorax becomes relatively larger on expiration (lung shrinks, air volume constant)
- More visible on expiratory film — especially for subtle cases

**Supine CXR (ICU patient):**
- Air collects anteriorly (supine position)
- "Deep sulcus sign" — abnormally deep, lucent costophrenic angle
- May not see classic apical line

### Tension Pneumothorax

**Definition:** Air continuously enters pleural space but cannot escape → progressive pressure increase → mediastinal shift → cardiovascular collapse

**Clinical (should be diagnosed clinically):**
- Severe respiratory distress
- Tracheal deviation away from side
- Absent breath sounds unilaterally
- Hypotension, tachycardia
- **Do NOT wait for X-ray — immediate needle decompression**

**Radiographic features (if time allows):**
- Complete lung collapse
- **Marked mediastinal shift away from pneumothorax**
- Depression of ipsilateral hemidiaphragm
- Contralateral lung compressed

### Hydropneumothorax

- Air and fluid in pleural space
- Upright: horizontal air-fluid level (straight line) — distinguishes from effusion (curved meniscus)
- Common after trauma, following thoracentesis

## 18.3 Pleural Thickening and Calcification

### Pleural Thickening

**Definition:** Increase in pleural tissue thickness >3 mm

**Causes:**
- Prior empyema or hemothorax (most common)
- Asbestos exposure
- Prior TB pleuritis
- Malignant mesothelioma
- Post-radiation

**Radiographic features:**
- Diffuse or localized increase in pleural density
- Blunted costophrenic angle (even without active effusion)
- Reduced lung volume
- Differential: loculated effusion vs. pleural peel

### Pleural Plaques (Asbestos-Related)

**Asbestos exposure → pleural plaques:**
- Most common manifestation of asbestos exposure
- Bilateral, smooth, well-defined pleural thickenings
- Typically on parietal pleura
- Classic locations: diaphragm, lower lateral chest wall
- Calcification common (appears as dense, irregular plaques on X-ray)

**CT features:**
- Bilateral, discrete pleural plaques
- Sparing of pleural apex (costophrenic angles may be free)
- Calcification within plaques

**Note:** Pleural plaques are NOT premalignant; indicate exposure risk for mesothelioma and other asbestos-related disease

### Pleural Calcification

**Causes:**
- Old hemothorax or empyema (most common)
- Asbestos-related plaques
- Old TB pleuritis
- Past pyothorax

**Appearance:** Dense white areas along the pleural surface; may form "eggshell" appearance

### Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma

**Risk factor:** Asbestos exposure (30-40 year latent period)

**Radiographic features:**
- Unilateral pleural effusion
- Lobulated, nodular pleural thickening
- Progressive encasement of the lung ("pleural rind")
- Reduced hemithorax volume (despite effusion)
- Involvement of mediastinal pleura

**CT features:**
- Circumferential pleural thickening
- Nodularity, lobulation
- Invasion of chest wall, mediastinum, diaphragm
- Pleural effusion

## 18.4 Empyema and Complicated Effusions

### Definition

Empyema = pus in the pleural space. A spectrum from parapneumonic effusion to frank empyema.

### Stages of Parapneumonic Effusion / Empyema

| Stage | Characteristics | Management |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Exudative (simple) | Clear exudate; pH >7.2; glucose >60 mg/dL; LDH &lt;1000 | Antibiotics alone |
| Fibrinopurulent | Fibrin deposition; loculations forming; pH &lt;7.2 | Chest tube drainage ± fibrinolytics |
| Organizing (chronic) | Thick fibrous peel; lung trapped | Surgical decortication |

### Radiographic Features

**CXR:**
- Opacity in pleural space (may appear identical to simple effusion)
- Loculated appearance suggests empyema
- Lenticular or D-shaped opacity
- Associated consolidation (pneumonia often present)

**CT features (definitive):**
- **"Split pleura" sign:** Enhancement of both visceral and parietal pleura, separating around the fluid collection — highly specific for empyema
- Thick, enhancing pleural walls
- Internal loculations (septa within fluid)
- Hyperdense fluid (protein content high)
- Associated lung compression/atelectasis

### Distinguishing Empyema from Lung Abscess on CT

| Feature | Empyema | Lung Abscess |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Shape | Lenticular (lens-shaped); conforms to chest wall | Spherical; within lung |
| Walls | Smooth, thin (split pleura sign) | Thick, irregular |
| Effect on lung | Compressed externally | Cavity within lung |
| Air-fluid level | Horizontal (gravity) | Round spherical cavity |
| Vessels | Run to the edge of collection | Run through/around |

### Hemothorax

- Blood in the pleural space
- Causes: trauma, aortic dissection, ruptured pleural adhesion, coagulopathy
- Appearance: same as effusion on CXR
- CT: hyperdense fluid (>35-70 HU) may indicate hemothorax
- Urgent chest tube drainage required for large hemothorax
- Residual blood can organize into fibrothorax

## Key Points Summary

1. **Pleural effusion** appears as blunted costophrenic angle on PA CXR (from 175 mL); meniscus sign; mediastinal shift with large effusions

2. **Fissural fluid** ("phantom tumor") — elliptical opacity in fissure that disappears with diuresis; common in heart failure

3. **Pneumothorax** — white pleural line with absent lung markings peripherally; seen at apex on PA CXR; deep sulcus sign on supine view

4. **Tension pneumothorax** — clinical diagnosis requiring immediate decompression; marked mediastinal shift away from pneumothorax

5. **Split pleura sign** on CT — enhancement of both pleural layers separated by fluid — highly specific for empyema

6. **Pleural plaques** from asbestos — bilateral, calcified, parietal pleural thickenings; NOT premalignant but marker of asbestos exposure
