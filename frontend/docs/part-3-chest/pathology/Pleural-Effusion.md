# Chapter 18: Pleural Effusion

## Overview
Pleural effusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the visceral and parietal pleura. It can be classified as transudative or exudative based on protein content and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

## Radiographic Appearance
- **Chest X-ray**:
  - Blunting of costophrenic angles (earliest sign)
  - Meniscus sign: concave upper border of fluid collection
  - Homogeneous opacity in lower lung zones
  - Obliteration of diaphragmatic contour
  - Mediastinal shift in massive effusions
- **Lateral decubitus film**: Confirms mobility of fluid
- **CT scan**: Better visualization of loculated effusions and underlying pathology

## Classification
- **Transudative**: Heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome
- **Exudative**: Pneumonia, malignancy, pulmonary embolism, connective tissue diseases

## Associated Findings
- **Empyema**: Infected pleural fluid with thickened pleural walls
- **Hemothorax**: Blood in pleural space
- **Chylothorax**: Chylous fluid accumulation

## Clinical Correlation
- Progressive dyspnea
- Decreased breath sounds
- Dullness to percussion
- Chest pain (if associated with inflammation)

## Key Learning Points
- Small effusions may only show blunted costophrenic angles
- Large effusions can cause mediastinal shift
- Differentiate from other causes of unilateral opacity
