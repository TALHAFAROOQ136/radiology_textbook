# Chapter 16: Pulmonary Consolidation and Airspace Disease

## Overview
Pulmonary consolidation refers to the filling of pulmonary alveolar air spaces with fluid, pus, blood, cells (including neoplastic cells), or other substances. This condition replaces the normal air-filled lung tissue with solid material, leading to characteristic radiographic findings.

## Radiographic Appearance
- **Chest X-ray**: Appears as homogeneous opacification of lung parenchyma, often with preservation of anatomical borders such as fissures
- **Air bronchograms**: Tubular lucencies representing air-containing bronchi surrounded by consolidated lung tissue
- **Silhouette sign**: Loss of normal borders between structures of similar density

## Common Causes
- **Infectious**: Bacterial pneumonia (most common), viral pneumonia, fungal infections
- **Non-infectious**: Pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, neoplasm, aspiration

## Differential Diagnosis
1. **Lobar pneumonia**: Typically confined to a lobe with sharp margins
2. **Multilobar pneumonia**: Involves multiple lobes
3. **Organizing pneumonia**: Patchy consolidation with irregular margins
4. **Alveolar carcinoma**: May mimic consolidation with air bronchograms

## Clinical Correlation
- Fever, cough, and sputum production in infectious causes
- Dyspnea and hypoxia depending on extent of involvement
- Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and increased tactile fremitus

## Key Learning Points
- Consolidation appears as homogeneous opacity with air bronchograms
- Always correlate with clinical presentation
- Consider infectious versus non-infectious etiologies
