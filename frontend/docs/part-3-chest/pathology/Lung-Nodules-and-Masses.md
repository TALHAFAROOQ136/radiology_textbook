# Chapter 19: Lung Nodules and Masses

## Overview
Lung nodules are rounded opacities ≤3 cm in diameter, while masses are >3 cm. Differentiation between benign and malignant lesions is crucial for appropriate management.

## Radiographic Features
- **Size**: Lesions >3 cm are considered masses and more likely malignant
- **Margins**: Smooth (benign) vs. spiculated (suggesting malignancy)
- **Calcification patterns**: Central, stippled, or eccentric calcification
- **Growth rate**: Doubling time helps differentiate benign from malignant

## Benign Causes
- Granulomas (histoplasmosis, tuberculosis)
- Hamartomas
- Inflammatory pseudotumors
- Organized pneumonia

## Malignant Causes
- Primary lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, small cell)
- Metastatic disease
- Carcinoid tumors

## Assessment Criteria
- **Fleischner Society Guidelines**: Size-based recommendations for follow-up
- **Solid vs. subsolid nodules**: Different management approaches
- **Upper lobe predominance**: Higher suspicion for malignancy

## Clinical Correlation
- Smoking history
- Age and risk factors
- Symptoms (hemoptysis, weight loss)
- Prior imaging comparison

## Key Learning Points
- Nodules < 4 mm: low probability of malignancy
- Spiculated margins increase malignancy risk
- Growth over time suggests malignancy
- Compare with prior studies when available
