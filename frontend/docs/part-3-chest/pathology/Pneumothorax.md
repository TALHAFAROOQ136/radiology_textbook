# Chapter 17: Pneumothorax

## Overview
Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, causing partial or complete collapse of the lung. It can be spontaneous, traumatic, or iatrogenic in origin.

## Radiographic Appearance
- **Chest X-ray**:
  - Sharp, thin line representing the visceral pleura
  - Absence of lung markings peripheral to this line
  - Shift of mediastinal structures in tension pneumothorax
- **Apical pleural blebs**: Small air collections at lung apices in spontaneous cases
- **Deep sulcus sign**: Abnormally deep costophrenic angle on lateral decubitus films

## Types
- **Primary spontaneous**: Occurs without underlying lung disease
- **Secondary spontaneous**: Associated with underlying lung pathology
- **Traumatic**: Due to penetrating or blunt chest trauma
- **Tension**: Life-threatening form with mediastinal shift

## Clinical Presentation
- Acute onset dyspnea and chest pain
- Decreased breath sounds on affected side
- Hyperresonance to percussion
- Tension pneumothorax: severe respiratory distress, hypotension, tracheal deviation

## Key Learning Points
- Look for the visceral pleural line without lung markings peripherally
- Identify tension pneumothorax as a medical emergency
- Assess for underlying lung pathology in secondary pneumothorax
