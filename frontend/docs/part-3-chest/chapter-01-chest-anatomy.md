# Chapter 1: Chest Anatomy for Radiology

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Identify the key anatomical structures visible on chest radiographs
- Understand the normal radiological appearance of thoracic structures
- Recognize the positioning requirements for optimal chest imaging
- Appreciate the variations in chest anatomy across different populations

## Introduction to Chest Anatomy

The chest (thorax) is a complex anatomical region containing vital organs and structures essential for respiration and circulation. Understanding chest anatomy is fundamental to interpreting chest radiographs, which are among the most commonly ordered radiological examinations. The chest radiograph provides a 2-dimensional view of 3-dimensional structures, making anatomical knowledge crucial for accurate interpretation.

### Overview of Thoracic Structures

The thoracic cavity contains:

- **Respiratory system**: Lungs, trachea, bronchi, pleura
- **Cardiovascular system**: Heart, great vessels, pericardium
- **Other structures**: Esophagus, thymus, lymph nodes, bones

## The Thoracic Cage

### Bones

The thoracic cage provides structural support and protection for thoracic organs:

- **Sternum**: Composed of manubrium, body, and xiphoid process
- **Ribs**: 12 pairs of ribs, with first 7 being true ribs (attached to sternum)
- **Thoracic vertebrae**: 12 vertebrae (T1-T12) forming the posterior aspect
- **Clavicles and scapulae**: Appear in chest radiographs depending on positioning

### Cartilage

- **Costal cartilage**: Connects ribs to sternum (visible on radiographs as continuation of ribs)
- **Articular cartilage**: At joints (not visible on conventional radiographs)

## Respiratory System

### Lungs

The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system:

- **Right lung**: 3 lobes (upper, middle, lower) divided by oblique and horizontal fissures
- **Left lung**: 2 lobes (upper, lower) divided by oblique fissure only
- **Lung markings**: Vascular and bronchial structures that create the normal lung pattern
- **Hilum**: Area where vessels, bronchi, and lymphatics enter/exit the lungs

### Airways

- **Trachea**: Midline structure that bifurcates at carina (around T4-T5 level)
- **Main bronchi**: Right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than left
- **Bronchial tree**: Branches progressively to segmental bronchi

### Pleura

- **Visceral pleura**: Covers lung surfaces
- **Parietal pleura**: Lines chest wall
- **Pleural space**: Potential space between the two layers, normally containing minimal fluid

## Cardiovascular System

### Heart

The heart is located in the mediastinum:

- **Four chambers**: Right/left atria and ventricles
- **Heart borders**:
  - Right heart border: Formed by SVC, RA, and RV
  - Left heart border: Formed by LV and LA appendage
- **Cardiac silhouette**: Normal cardiothoracic ratio should be `<50%`

### Great Vessels

- **Superior vena cava (SVC)**: Right upper mediastinal structure
- **Aortic arch**: Prominent structure in the upper mediastinum
- **Ascending aorta**: Forms right heart border
- **Descending aorta**: Left posterior mediastinal structure

## Mediastinum

The mediastinum is divided into three compartments:

### Anterior Mediastinum
- Contains thymus, fat, lymph nodes
- Located between sternum and heart/vessels

### Middle Mediastinum
- Contains heart, great vessels, trachea, main bronchi
- Most common location for mediastinal masses

### Posterior Mediastinum
- Contains esophagus, descending aorta, azygos vein
- Contains lymph nodes and nerves

## Soft Tissue Structures

### Breast Tissue
- Appears as soft tissue density in anterior chest
- Should be symmetric in normal individuals

### Pectoral Muscles
- Pectoralis major and minor muscles
- May overlap lung apices, especially in males

### Diaphragm
- Dome-shaped muscle separating thoracic and abdominal cavities
- Right hemidiaphragm is typically higher than left due to liver

## Positioning for Chest Radiography

### Posteroanterior (PA) Projection
- Patient stands facing image receptor
- Shoulders rolled forward to move scapulae out of lung fields
- Arms raised to clear lung bases
- Exposure at end-inspiration for optimal lung expansion

### Lateral Projection
- Patient stands with left side against image receptor
- Arms raised above head to clear lung fields
- Exposure at end-inspiration
- Left lateral preferred to avoid cardiac magnification

### Variations and Special Considerations
- **AP supine**: For bedridden patients, may show cardiomegaly due to magnification
- **Lordotic view**: To better visualize lung apices
- **Expiratory films**: To differentiate pneumothorax from skin folds

## Normal Radiographic Appearance

### Lung Fields
- Should be lucent (black) with visible pulmonary vessels
- Normal lung markings follow bronchovascular bundles
- No focal consolidation, masses, or effusions

### Diaphragm
- Smooth, dome-shaped contours
- Right hemidiaphragm typically 1-2 cm higher than left
- Costophrenic angles sharp and well-defined

### Mediastinum
- Should be centrally positioned
- Normal width less than one-third of thoracic diameter at diaphragm level
- No widening or displacement of structures

### Bony Structures
- No acute fractures or lytic lesions
- Normal alignment and mineralization
- Symmetric appearance

## Variants and Normal Anatomy

### Anatomical Variants
- **Azygos lobe**: Normal variant in right upper lobe
- **Cervical ribs**: Extra ribs at C7 level
- **Accessory fissures**: Additional fissures in lungs

### Age-Related Changes
- **Children**: Larger thymus, smaller heart
- **Elderly**: Calcifications, kyphosis, increased vascular prominence

### Gender Differences
- **Female**: Breast shadows, different thoracic configuration
- **Male**: Generally larger chest, different muscle mass

## Common Anatomical Landmarks

### On PA Chest
- **Carina**: Where trachea bifurcates
- **Aortic knuckle**: Prominent left upper mediastinal structure
- **Left ventricular point**: Most lateral and inferior point of cardiac silhouette
- **Right heart border**: Formed by SVC, RA, and RV

### On Lateral Chest
- **Carina**: Should be at or above T4-T5 level
- **Posterior tracheal stripe**: Visible posterior wall of trachea
- **Anterior and posterior junctions**: Points where diaphragmatic domes meet the chest wall

## Clinical Correlations

Understanding chest anatomy is essential for:
- Identifying normal vs. abnormal findings
- Localizing pathology
- Determining appropriate follow-up studies
- Communicating findings to clinicians

## Summary

Chest anatomy is complex but systematic. A thorough understanding of normal anatomical structures and their radiological appearance is fundamental to accurate chest radiograph interpretation. Proper positioning and recognition of normal variants are equally important for avoiding misdiagnosis.

## Key Terms

- **Cardiothoracic ratio**: Ratio of cardiac width to thoracic width
- **Carina**: Point where trachea bifurcates
- **Fissures**: Separations between lung lobes
- **Hilum**: Area where vessels and bronchi enter/exit lungs
- **Pneumothorax**: Air in pleural space
- **Effusion**: Fluid in pleural space
- **Cardiomegaly**: Enlarged heart

## Review Questions

1. Describe the differences between the right and left lungs in terms of lobar anatomy.
2. Explain why the right hemidiaphragm is typically higher than the left on chest radiographs.
3. What are the four chambers of the heart and how do they contribute to the cardiac silhouette?
4. List three normal anatomical variants that can be seen on chest radiographs.
