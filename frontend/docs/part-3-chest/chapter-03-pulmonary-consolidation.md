## 16.1 Understanding Pulmonary Consolidation

### Definition

**Consolidation** occurs when alveolar air is replaced by fluid (exudate, blood, edema), cells (inflammatory cells, tumor cells), or other material. This results in increased density (whiteness) on chest X-ray.

### Radiographic Signs of Consolidation

**Air bronchogram:**
- Air-filled bronchi visible within the consolidated (opacified) lung
- Pathognomonic of alveolar consolidation (not atelectasis where bronchi collapse)
- Air bronchograms visible because surrounding alveoli are fluid-filled but airways remain patent

**Silhouette sign:**
- When consolidation contacts a structure of similar density (heart, diaphragm), the border disappears
- Right lower lobe consolidation → right heart border lost
- Right middle lobe consolidation → right heart border lost
- Left lower lobe consolidation → left heart border preserved (left lower lobe is posterior to heart)

**Consolidation characteristics:**
- Non-segmental or segmental distribution
- Homogeneous or heterogeneous density
- May have air bronchograms
- Lobar or multilobar involvement possible

### Consolidation vs. Atelectasis

| Feature | Consolidation | Atelectasis |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Air bronchograms | Present | Absent (airways collapse) |
| Lung volume | Preserved or increased | Reduced |
| Fissure shift | Away from consolidation | Toward collapsed area |
| Density | Variable | Dense, complete |

## 16.2 Bacterial Pneumonia

### Lobar Pneumonia

**Typical bacteria:** Streptococcus pneumoniae (most common cause of lobar pneumonia)

**Radiographic features:**
- Confluent consolidation filling an entire lobe or segment
- Air bronchograms present
- No volume loss (or slight expansion in "bulging fissure" sign)
- Silhouette sign helps localize lobe

**Klebsiella pneumonia ("Friedlander's pneumonia"):**
- Particularly causes lobar consolidation
- Classic: "bulging fissure" sign (expanded lobe pushing fissure outward)
- Associated with cavitation and abscess formation
- Typically in alcoholics and immunocompromised

### Bronchopneumonia

**Typical bacteria:** Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, gram-negative organisms

**Radiographic features:**
- Patchy, multifocal airspace opacities
- Peribronchial (central) distribution
- Bilateral lower lobe predominance
- Often associated with hyperinflation in children

**Staphylococcal pneumonia (particularly in children and IVDU):**
- Pneumatoceles (thin-walled cystic spaces)
- Rapid cavitation
- Empyema
- Bilateral involvement

### Atypical Pneumonia

**Organisms:** Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella

**"Atypical" because:**
- Clinical syndrome often milder than X-ray suggests
- Less lobar pattern; more interstitial/patchy

**Radiographic features:**
- Peribronchial thickening
- Patchy subsegmental consolidation
- Bilateral involvement common
- Hilar lymphadenopathy (Mycoplasma)

**Legionella:**
- Rapidly progressive lobar consolidation
- Can progress to bilateral involvement
- Round pneumonia pattern sometimes

## 16.3 Aspiration Pneumonia

### Mechanism

Aspiration of gastric contents or oropharyngeal secretions leads to chemical pneumonitis followed by bacterial pneumonia.

### Risk Factors

- Reduced consciousness (alcohol, sedation, stroke, seizures)
- Dysphagia
- Gastroesophageal reflux
- Poor dentition
- Nasogastric tubes

### Dependent Distribution

**Upright patient:** Aspiration goes to lower lobes (especially right lower lobe)
**Supine patient:** Aspiration goes to posterior segments of upper lobes and superior segments of lower lobes

**Right-sided predominance:**
- Right mainstem bronchus is more vertical and straight
- Aspirated material more likely to enter right lower lobe

### Radiographic Features

- Patchy consolidation in dependent regions
- Right lower lobe (most common) or bilateral lower lobes
- Posterior distribution on lateral view
- May have "gravity-dependent" distribution change if position changes

### Complications

- Lung abscess (especially anaerobic aspiration)
- Empyema
- ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)

## 16.4 Lung Abscess

### Definition

A necrotic area of lung parenchyma containing purulent material, usually resulting from liquefaction of consolidated lung.

### Etiology

- Aspiration (most common cause)
- Post-obstructive (proximal tumor or foreign body)
- Necrotizing pneumonia
- Septic emboli (IVDU, right-sided endocarditis)

### Radiographic Features

**Classic appearance:**
- Thick-walled cavity with air-fluid level
- Rounded or oval cavity
- Location: posterior segment of upper lobe or superior segment of lower lobe (dependent distribution from aspiration)
- Diameter typically 2–8 cm

**Air-fluid level:**
- Visible on upright or lateral decubitus views
- Horizontal level within the cavity
- Indicates communication with a bronchus (drainage occurred)

**Progression:**
- Starts as area of consolidation
- Develops necrosis and liquefaction (1–2 weeks)
- Cavity forms after drainage through bronchus
- Air-fluid level appears

### Differential Diagnosis of Cavitary Lesion

- Lung abscess
- Tuberculosis (upper lobe, often no air-fluid level)
- Cavitating carcinoma (irregular, shaggy walls)
- Infected bulla or cyst
- Hydatid cyst (echinococcal)
- Wegener's granulomatosis (now GPA)

## 16.5 Tuberculosis (TB) Imaging

### Primary TB

**Occurs in:** First-time exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis

**Ghon complex:**
1. Parenchymal focus (Ghon focus) — small area of consolidation, often lower lobe
2. Ipsilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
3. Together = Ghon complex (when both visible)

**Radiographic features of primary TB:**
- Lower or middle zone consolidation (any lobe)
- Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (prominent in children)
- Usually self-limited; may calcify ("Ranke complex")
- Pleural effusion can occur

### Post-Primary (Reactivation) TB

**Occurs in:** Immunocompromised, elderly, reactivation of dormant bacilli

**Characteristic location:** **Upper lobe** — posterior segments; superior segments of lower lobes
- Reason: Higher oxygen tension in upper lobes favors mycobacterial growth

**Radiographic features:**
- Patchy or confluent consolidation in upper lobes
- Cavitation (very common in post-primary) — irregular thick-walled cavities
- Fibrosis and volume loss of affected lobe
- Satellite nodules around main lesion
- Bilateral involvement (spread via airways)
- Tree-in-bud pattern on CT (endobronchial spread)

**Miliary TB:**
- Hematogenous dissemination
- Innumerable tiny nodules (1–3 mm) uniformly distributed throughout both lungs
- Pattern resembles millet seeds on X-ray
- Associated with immunocompromised state (HIV, severe malnutrition)
- CT detects earlier than X-ray

### Complications of TB

- **Cavity:** Risk of hemoptysis and Aspergilloma (mycetoma growing in old TB cavity)
- **Aspergilloma:** Rounded opacity within a pre-existing cavity; "air crescent sign"
- **Bronchiectasis:** End-stage fibrotic TB with dilated bronchi
- **Empyema:** Pleural space infection
- **Pericardial disease**
- **Spinal TB (Pott's disease):** Vertebral body destruction with paravertebral abscess

## 16.6 COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonias

### COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Imaging

**Chest X-ray findings:**
- Often normal in early disease
- Bilateral peripheral airspace opacities (ground-glass or consolidation)
- Lower lobe predominance
- Pattern may be quite subtle on CXR; CT is far more sensitive

**CT findings (ground-glass opacity — GGO):**
- **Ground-glass opacity:** Increased density that does NOT obscure vessels — hallmark of COVID-19
- Bilateral, peripheral, lower lobe dominant
- "Crazy paving": GGO + septal thickening (more advanced disease)
- Consolidation indicates more severe disease
- Posterior-dependent GGO
- Round/polygonal opacities

**CO-RADS system:**
- CT reporting system for COVID-19 probability
- CO-RADS 1: very low probability; CO-RADS 5: very high probability

### Influenza Pneumonia

- Bilateral patchy consolidation or GGO
- May progress rapidly to ARDS
- Superimposed bacterial pneumonia common

### Viral Pneumonia General Features

- Bilateral perihilar or diffuse involvement
- Ground-glass opacities (CT) — better seen on CT than CXR
- May progress to ARDS pattern (diffuse bilateral opacities)

## Key Points Summary

1. **Air bronchogram** — pathognomonic of alveolar consolidation; air-filled bronchi visible in fluid-filled lung

2. **Silhouette sign** — loss of normally sharp border between structures of similar density indicates adjacent consolidation

3. **Klebsiella pneumonia** — classic "bulging fissure" sign; common in alcoholics

4. **Aspiration pneumonia** — posterior/dependent segment distribution; right lower lobe most common in upright patients

5. **Lung abscess** — thick-walled cavity with air-fluid level; starts as consolidation, then cavitates

6. **TB reactivation** — upper lobe location (posterior segments); cavitation common; tree-in-bud on CT for endobronchial spread

7. **COVID-19 CT** — bilateral peripheral GGO, lower lobe dominant; crazy paving in advanced disease
