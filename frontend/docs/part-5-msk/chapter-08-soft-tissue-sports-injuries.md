## 38.1 Knee Ligament and Meniscal Injuries

### ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Tear

**Mechanism:** Non-contact pivoting/twisting; deceleration; valgus force

**"Unhappy Triad" (O'Donoghue's):**
- ACL tear + MCL tear + medial meniscus tear
- Mechanism: valgus force with rotation

**MRI features of ACL tear:**

**Primary signs:**
- **Complete disruption:** Non-visualization of ACL or discontinuous fibers
- **Abnormal signal:** High T2/PD signal within or replacing ACL fibers
- **"Empty intercondylar notch" sign**
- ACL fibers fail to run from posterior lateral femoral condyle to anterior tibia

**Secondary signs (associated findings):**
- **Bone bruise:** Kissing contusions at lateral femoral condyle and posterior lateral tibial plateau ("pivot shift" bone bruise)
- **Segond fracture:** Lateral tibial plateau rim avulsion — highly specific (pathognomonic) for ACL tear
- Anterior tibial translation
- Posterior lateral femoral condyle contusion + posterolateral tibial plateau contusion = "coup" and "contrecoup"

### PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament)

- Larger, stronger than ACL
- Normal: Bow-tie shaped, uniformly dark (low T2 signal)
- Tear: High T2 signal, discontinuity
- Mechanism: Dashboard injury (posterior tibial force)

### Meniscal Tears

**MRI grading of meniscal signal:**
- Grade 0: Normal — homogeneous dark signal
- Grade 1: Globular high signal (not reaching articular surface) — intrasubstance degeneration
- Grade 2: Linear high signal not reaching articular surface
- **Grade 3: High signal reaching articular surface = tear**

**Types of meniscal tears:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Horizontal | Parallel to tibial plateau; often degenerative |
| Vertical longitudinal | Parallel to long axis of meniscus; acute/traumatic |
| **Bucket-handle** | Large vertical longitudinal tear; displaced fragment → medial notch |
| Radial | Perpendicular to meniscal rim |
| Complex | Multiple planes |

**Bucket-handle tear:**
- "Double PCL sign": Displaced meniscus fragment in intercondylar notch (simulates second PCL)
- "Absent bow-tie sign": &lt;2 bow-tie images on sagittal MRI
- "Flipped meniscus"

## 38.2 Rotator Cuff Tears

### Anatomy

Four muscles of the rotator cuff:
- **S**upraspinatus (most commonly torn)
- **I**nfraspinatus
- **T**eres minor
- **S**ubscapularis

**Mnemonic:** SITS

### Classification

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Partial-thickness | Does not extend through full thickness |
| Full-thickness (complete) | Extends from articular to bursal surface |
| Massive | Involves ≥2 tendons |

### MRI Features

**Normal supraspinatus:** Low signal on all sequences (dark)

**Tendinopathy (no tear):**
- Intermediate or high signal on T1 and PD
- Intact tendon

**Partial tear:**
- High signal extending partially through tendon
- Articular-sided partial tears most common

**Full-thickness tear:**
- High T2 signal gap through the full tendon
- Fluid fills the defect (T2 hyperintense)
- Tendon retraction toward musculotendinous junction
- Secondary: Muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration

**Signs of chronic/massive tear:**
- Muscle atrophy (volume loss)
- Fatty infiltration (increased T1 signal in muscle — Goutallier classification)
- Superior migration of humeral head (acromiohumeral distance &lt;7 mm)

### Ultrasound for Rotator Cuff

- Excellent for full-thickness tears (sensitivity 90-95%)
- Dynamic imaging: assess impingement
- Partial tears: moderate sensitivity (~70%)
- Operator-dependent

## 38.3 Achilles Tendon Pathology

### Anatomy

- Largest tendon in the body
- Insertion at posterior calcaneus
- Blood supply: poor in central portion 2-6 cm proximal to insertion ("watershed zone")

### Tendinopathy (Non-Insertion)

- Degeneration and thickening at watershed zone (2-6 cm from insertion)
- MRI: Thickened tendon; intrasubstance high T2 signal; "fusiform swelling"
- Ultrasound: Tendon thickening, hypoechoic changes, neovascularization on Doppler

### Achilles Tendon Rupture

**Mechanism:** Sudden plantarflexion; eccentric loading

**Clinical:** "Feeling kicked from behind"; palpable gap; positive Thompson test

**MRI features:**
- Complete: Gap in Achilles tendon; fluid-filled defect on T2
- Tendon ends may be retracted
- Hematoma in gap

**Ultrasound:**
- Real-time assessment
- "Kager's fat pad" herniates into gap
- Thompson test dynamic assessment

**Management:** Surgical repair vs. conservative (non-weight-bearing in equinus) — ongoing debate

### Insertional Tendinopathy

- At tendon-bone junction
- Haglund deformity: Prominent posterior superior calcaneal tuberosity → impingement
- Retrocalcaneal bursitis: Fluid between tendon and calcaneus
- MRI: Enthesopathy, bone edema, bursitis

## 38.4 Stress Fractures

### Definition

Fracture from repetitive submaximal loading that exceeds the bone's reparative capacity; no single traumatic event.

### Types

**Fatigue fractures:** Normal bone subjected to abnormal repetitive loading
- Military recruits, athletes
- Metatarsals ("march fracture"), tibia, femoral neck, navicular

**Insufficiency fractures:** Abnormal bone (osteoporotic) subjected to normal loading
- Elderly women; sacral stress fractures; pubic rami

### Common Sites by Sport/Activity

| Site | Sport/Activity |
|------|---------------|
| 2nd-3rd metatarsal | Running, military training ("march fracture") |
| Tibia (posterior) | Running |
| Femoral neck | Runners, military |
| Navicular | Basketball, jumping |
| Lumbar pars (spondylolysis) | Gymnastics, cricket, batting |
| Pubic rami | Postmenopausal women, long-distance runners |
| Sacrum | Elderly, post-radiation |

### Imaging

**Plain X-ray:**
- Insensitive in early stages (negative in first 2 weeks)
- Periosteal reaction ("stress reaction") earliest X-ray sign
- Sclerotic line through bone (late)
- "Hot cross bun" sign: transverse sclerotic line

**MRI (most sensitive):**
- **T1:** Linear low signal (fracture line)
- **T2/STIR:** Periosteal edema and bone marrow edema (high signal)
- Detects stress fractures within 24-72 hours
- Classification:
  - Grade 1: Periosteal edema only
  - Grade 2: Periosteal + marrow edema
  - Grade 3: Fracture line visible on T2
  - Grade 4: Fracture line on T1 and T2

**Bone scan:**
- Hot spot (focally increased uptake)
- Sensitive but non-specific

## 38.5 Muscle Strains

### Grading

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Grade I | Strain — microtears; no macroscopic disruption |
| Grade II | Partial tear — palpable defect |
| Grade III | Complete rupture |

### MRI Features

**Grade I:** STIR/T2 high signal (edema) within muscle; no architectural disruption

**Grade II:** Partial fiber disruption with hematoma; myofascial plane involvement; architectural distortion

**Grade III:** Complete muscle tear; muscle retraction; hematoma; "drooping muscle" appearance

### Common Sites

- **Hamstrings:** Proximal (at ischial tuberosity) — from sprinting
- **Quadriceps:** Rectus femoris — from kicking
- **Gastrocnemius medial head:** "Tennis leg" — sudden push-off
- **Adductors:** From twisting/sudden direction change

### Ultrasound for Muscle Injuries

- Acute: Hypoechoic edema or anechoic hematoma
- Dynamic assessment: Contraction reveals tear
- Guides aspiration of hematoma if indicated

## Key Points Summary

1. **Grade 3 meniscal signal** (reaching articular surface) = tear; bucket-handle tear shows "double PCL sign"

2. **Segond fracture** (lateral tibial rim avulsion) is pathognomonic for ACL tear

3. **Bone bruise pattern** (lateral femoral condyle + posterior lateral tibial plateau) = pivot shift/ACL injury mechanism

4. **Rotator cuff:** Supraspinatus most commonly torn; full-thickness tear shows fluid-filled gap on T2 MRI

5. **Stress fracture:** X-ray negative in first 2 weeks; MRI detects bone marrow edema within 24-72 hours

6. **Achilles tendon rupture** — gap on MRI/US; 2-6 cm proximal to insertion (watershed zone)
