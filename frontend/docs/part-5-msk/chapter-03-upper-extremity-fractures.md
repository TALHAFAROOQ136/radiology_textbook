# Chapter 33: Upper Extremity Fractures

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and describe common hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder fractures
- Recognize diagnostic features of scaphoid, Colles, supracondylar, and clavicle fractures
- Apply appropriate imaging sequence for specific injuries

---

## 33.1 Hand and Finger Fractures

### Boxer's Fracture

**Definition:** Fracture of the neck of the 5th metacarpal (sometimes 4th)

**Mechanism:** Direct punch with clenched fist

**Radiographic features (oblique view best):**
- Fracture at neck of 5th metacarpal
- Volar angulation of the head (apex dorsal)
- Acceptable angulation: &lt;40° (5th MC); &lt;20° (4th MC)
- Shortening possible

### Mallet Finger

**Definition:** Avulsion of the extensor tendon from the base of the distal phalanx ± bony fragment

**Mechanism:** Forced flexion of extended DIP joint (ball hitting fingertip)

**Radiographic features (lateral view critical):**
- Avulsion fracture at dorsal base of distal phalanx (bony mallet)
- If no bony fragment: tendon disruption only (no X-ray abnormality)
- DIP joint may be slightly flexed

**Management:** Extension splinting of DIP joint for 6-8 weeks; surgery if large fragment (>30% articular surface)

### Bennett Fracture

**Definition:** Intra-articular fracture-dislocation of the 1st CMC joint (base of thumb metacarpal)

**Mechanism:** Axial force on flexed thumb

**Radiographic features:**
- Small medial fragment (Bennett fragment) held by anterior oblique ligament
- Main metacarpal shaft displaced proximally and radially

### Rolando Fracture

- Comminuted Bennett fracture (Y or T shaped fracture at thumb base)
- Worse prognosis than Bennett

## 33.2 Wrist Fractures

### Colles Fracture

**Most common fracture in adults (especially older women with osteoporosis)**

**Mechanism:** Fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH) in extension

**Radiographic features (PA + lateral):**
- **Distal radius fracture** within 3 cm of radiocarpal joint
- **Dorsal angulation/tilting** of distal fragment (loss of normal volar tilt)
- **Radial shortening** (telescoping)
- **Radial deviation** of distal fragment
- Ulnar styloid fracture common (50%)
- "Dinner fork" deformity on lateral view

**Normal radial anatomy:**
- Radial inclination: ~22° (AP)
- Volar tilt: ~11° (lateral)

### Smith Fracture (Reverse Colles)

- Volar angulation (instead of dorsal) of distal fragment
- "Garden spade deformity"
- Mechanism: fall on dorsiflexed wrist (less common)

### Barton Fracture

- Intra-articular fracture of the dorsal or volar rim of the distal radius
- Fracture-subluxation of radiocarpal joint
- Unstable — requires surgical fixation

### Scaphoid Fracture

**Most clinically important wrist fracture to not miss**

**Mechanism:** FOOSH

**Why important:**
- Most common carpal fracture (70%)
- Blood supply enters distally → proximal pole avascular necrosis (AVN) risk if untreated
- Often occult on initial X-ray (20% of scaphoid fractures missed initially)

**Radiographic features:**
- Fracture through waist (most common), proximal pole, or distal pole
- May see linear lucency across scaphoid waist on scaphoid views
- 20% are NORMAL initially

**If clinical suspicion and negative X-ray:**
- **MRI:** Gold standard (most sensitive even within 24 hours)
- **CT:** Excellent for cortical detail; less sensitive for bone marrow edema in early injury
- Repeat X-ray at 10-14 days: callus may make fracture visible

**Complications:**
- AVN of proximal pole (if blood supply disrupted): sclerosis → collapse → arthritis
- Non-union
- Scapholunate dissociation (wrist instability)

## 33.3 Forearm Fractures

### Galeazzi Fracture

- **Radial shaft fracture** + **distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) dislocation**
- "Fracture of necessity" — DRUJ always disrupted
- Requires surgical fixation (unlike isolated radius fracture)
- DRUJ: widened ulnar gap, ulnar head dorsal

### Monteggia Fracture

- **Ulnar shaft fracture** + **radial head dislocation**
- "Monteggia reversed of Galeazzi"
- Bado classification (I-IV)
- Emergency — radial head must be reduced

**Rule:** Always look at the elbow if ulna fractured; always look at wrist if radius fractured

### Both Bone Forearm Fractures (BBFF)

- Both radius and ulna fractured at similar levels
- High-energy trauma
- Surgical fixation (plating) required

---

## 33.4 Elbow Fractures

### Supracondylar Humerus Fracture

**Most common elbow fracture in children (5-10 years)**

**Mechanism:** FOOSH with elbow in extension

**Radiographic features:**
- Posterior displacement of capitellum and distal humerus
- Anterior humeral line on lateral: should pass through anterior 1/3 of capitellum; passes anterior to it in supracondylar fracture
- "Sail sign": elevated anterior fat pad + visible posterior fat pad

**Gartland classification:**
- Type I: Non-displaced
- Type II: Displaced with intact posterior cortex
- Type III: Completely displaced (no posterior cortex contact)

**Emergency:** Risk of brachial artery injury, anterior interosseous nerve injury

**Neurovascular check mandatory before and after reduction**

### Radial Head Fracture

**Most common elbow fracture in adults**

**Mechanism:** FOOSH; compressive force on radial head

**Mason Classification:**
- Type I: Non-displaced (&lt;2 mm); can be treated conservatively
- Type II: Displaced/angulated >2 mm
- Type III: Comminuted
- Type IV: With elbow dislocation

**Radiographic features:**
- Fat pad sign: posterior fat pad elevated (effusion) — most reliable early sign
- Radial head fracture may be subtle or occult

**If clinical suspicion of radial head fracture with visible posterior fat pad but no fracture seen:**
- Treat as radial head fracture
- CT or MRI for confirmation if needed

## 33.5 Shoulder Fractures

### Clavicle Fractures

**Most common shoulder girdle fracture (80% of shoulder fractures)**

**Location:** Middle third (75%), lateral third (20%), medial third (5%)

**Radiographic features:**
- AP clavicle + cephalad angled view
- Mid-shaft most visible
- Lateral third may have AC joint involvement

**Neer classification for lateral clavicle:**
- Type I: Non-displaced (intact CC ligaments)
- Type II: Displaced with torn CC ligaments → surgical fixation

### Proximal Humerus Fractures

**Neer classification (based on 4 segments):**
- Anatomical neck
- Greater tuberosity
- Lesser tuberosity
- Surgical neck

"Parts" = number of segments displaced >1 cm or >45°:
- One-part: minimally displaced → conservative management
- Two/three/four-part: surgical fixation or arthroplasty (elderly)

**Most common:** Surgical neck fracture (conservative management usually)

**AVN risk:** Anatomical neck fractures (blood supply to humeral head severed)

### Scapula Fractures

- Usually result from high-energy trauma
- Associated with ipsilateral chest, shoulder, and neurovascular injuries
- CT essential for complex fractures

## Key Points Summary

1. **Boxer's fracture** — 5th metacarpal neck; volar angulation; &lt;40° acceptable for 5th MC

2. **Colles fracture** — most common adult fracture; dorsal angulation + radial shortening; "dinner fork" on lateral

3. **Scaphoid fracture** — 20% missed on initial X-ray; MRI gold standard if X-ray negative; AVN risk if untreated

4. **Galeazzi** = radius fracture + DRUJ dislocation; **Monteggia** = ulna fracture + radial head dislocation — always check the "other" joint

5. **Supracondylar fracture** — most common pediatric elbow fracture; check anterior humeral line; neurovascular emergency

6. **Posterior fat pad sign** at elbow = joint effusion = treat as fracture even if X-ray negative for fracture line
