# Chapter 36: Pediatric Fractures

## Learning Objectives

- Identify unique features of the pediatric skeleton relevant to fracture patterns
- Classify growth plate injuries using the Salter-Harris system
- Recognize greenstick and buckle fractures
- Describe common pediatric fractures and their management
- Identify radiographic patterns suggesting non-accidental injury (NAI)

## 36.1 Unique Features of the Pediatric Skeleton

### Why Children's Fractures Differ

**Physes (growth plates):**
- Open in children until skeletal maturity
- Weaker than ligaments → children more likely to fracture than sprain
- Physeal injuries can affect growth

**Periosteum:**
- Thicker and more vascular in children
- Provides more stability to fractures
- Can cause greenstick fractures (one cortex intact)

**Remodeling potential:**
- Children's bones remodel more than adults
- Residual deformity may correct with growth
- Greater angulation acceptable in younger children

**Ossification centers:**
- Not all centers visible at birth
- Must know normal ossification ages to avoid "missing fracture" vs. normal variant

### Elbow Ossification Centers — "CRITOE"

Mnemonic for order of appearance of elbow ossification centers:

| Center | Age of Appearance |
|--------|------------------|
| **C**apitellum | 1 year |
| **R**adial head | 3 years |
| **I**nternal (medial) epicondyle | 5 years |
| **T**rochlea | 7 years |
| **O**lecranon | 9 years |
| **E**xternal (lateral) epicondyle | 11 years |

**Rule:** If a later center is visible, earlier centers must also be visible. If missing — avulsion injury suspected.

**Trapped medial epicondyle:** Medial epicondyle avulsion trapped in elbow joint — "missing" medial epicondyle

## 36.2 Greenstick and Buckle Fractures

### Buckle (Torus) Fracture

**Definition:** Compression failure of one cortex causing a "buckling" or "torus" (from Greek: round protuberance)

**Mechanism:** Axial compression (FOOSH)

**Most common location:** Distal radius metaphysis

**Radiographic features:**
- Cortical bulge/bump on one side of bone
- No complete cortical disruption
- Contralateral cortex intact

**Management:** Plaster cast or removable splint for 3-4 weeks; heals well

### Greenstick Fracture

**Definition:** Incomplete fracture where one cortex breaks and the other bends (like a green stick)

**Mechanism:** Bending force

**Radiographic features:**
- Fracture on tension side (convex side)
- Opposite cortex bent but intact
- Angulation of the bone

**Management:** Often requires manipulation to reduce angulation; then casting

## 36.3 Salter-Harris Classification

### Classification of Physeal Injuries

The Salter-Harris (SH) classification describes growth plate fractures:

| Type | Pattern | Memory | Prognosis |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **SH I** | Fracture through physis only | "Straight across" | Excellent |
| **SH II** | Fracture through physis + metaphysis (most common) | "Above" | Good |
| **SH III** | Fracture through physis + epiphysis | "Lower" | Fair |
| **SH IV** | Fracture through metaphysis, physis, AND epiphysis | "Through" | Poor |
| **SH V** | Crush of the physis | "Rammed" | Worst |

**Mnemonic: "SALTR"**
- I: Slipped
- II: Above
- III: Lower
- IV: Through
- V: Rammed/Crush

**Prognosis:** Higher type number = more damage to growth plate = greater risk of growth arrest

**SH II:** Most common type (75%); generally excellent prognosis

**SH V:** Often missed; pure physeal crush; diagnosed retrospectively when growth arrest occurs

### Growth Arrest Lines and Angular Deformity

- Premature physeal closure → limb length discrepancy or angular deformity
- "Park-Harris growth arrest lines" — transverse lines in metaphysis from past stress/illness
- Bridge formation across physis (bony bar) → tethered growth on one side

## 36.4 Common Pediatric Fractures

### Supracondylar Humerus Fracture

**(See Chapter 33 for full description)**

- Most common elbow fracture in children 5-8 years
- Usually results from FOOSH
- Neurovascular injury risk (anterior interosseous nerve, brachial artery)
- Gartland III: emergency percutaneous pinning

### Lateral Condyle Fracture

**Second most common pediatric elbow fracture**

- Fracture through lateral condylar ossification center
- Salter-Harris IV (crosses physis and epiphysis)
- Risk of AVN and non-union if untreated

**Radiographic features:**
- Fracture line through lateral metaphysis, physis, and lateral condyle
- May be subtle
- Arthrogram helpful if cartilaginous extent unclear

**Management:** If displaced >2 mm → surgical fixation

### Clavicle Fractures

- Most common birth injury (shoulder dystocia)
- Most common fracture in children age 2-10
- Greenstick or complete middle-third fractures
- Heals rapidly in children

### Forearm Fractures

- Very common in children
- Usually metaphyseal buckle or greenstick
- Distal radius most common

## 36.5 Non-Accidental Injury (NAI) — Child Abuse Patterns

### Importance

Radiologists have a mandatory duty to recognize and report suspected NAI. Radiology findings are often the first objective evidence of abuse.

### Highly Specific Features for NAI

**"Classic metaphyseal lesion" (CML) / Corner fractures / Bucket-handle fractures:**
- Fractures at corner of metaphysis
- Result from shearing forces (shaking, yanking)
- **Highly specific** for non-accidental injury
- Most common in distal femur, proximal tibia, distal tibia

**Posterior rib fractures:**
- Near costovertebral junction
- Caused by squeezing of chest
- **Highly specific** for abuse (accidental rib fractures rare in infants)
- Multiple, bilateral

### Moderately Suspicious Features

- Multiple fractures in different stages of healing
- Fractures inconsistent with stated mechanism
- Epiphyseal separation
- Bilateral acute fractures (both same bones)

### Skeletal Survey for NAI

Standard protocol when NAI suspected:
- Full skeletal survey (25+ images covering whole body)
- Repeat at 10-14 days (may reveal fractures not visible initially)
- Bone scan: sensitive for rib fractures and cortical fractures

### Brain Injury in NAI (Shaken Baby Syndrome)

- Subdural hematoma (bilateral/interhemispheric)
- Retinal hemorrhages (ophthalmology)
- CT/MRI head essential
- Diffuse axonal injury

### Documentation

- Document all findings objectively
- Report to child protection team
- Provide opinion on mechanism consistency
- Forensic quality images required

## Key Points Summary

1. **CRITOE** mnemonic — order of elbow ossification centers: Capitellum (1), Radial head (3), Internal epicondyle (5), Trochlea (7), Olecranon (9), External epicondyle (11)

2. **Buckle fracture** — cortical buckling without complete break; common in distal radius; conservative management

3. **Greenstick fracture** — one cortex broken, one bent; requires reduction if angulated

4. **Salter-Harris classification:** Type I-V; higher type = worse prognosis; Type II most common

5. **Classic metaphyseal lesion** (corner fracture) + **posterior rib fractures** = highly specific for non-accidental injury

6. **Skeletal survey** mandatory when NAI suspected; repeat at 10-14 days to detect more fractures
