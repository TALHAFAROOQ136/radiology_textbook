# Chapter 34: Lower Extremity Fractures

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and classify common foot, ankle, knee, and hip fractures
- Apply Weber and other classification systems to ankle fractures
- Recognize hip fractures and their subtypes in elderly patients
- Describe the imaging evaluation of lower extremity trauma

## 34.1 Foot Fractures

### Calcaneus Fractures

**Mechanism:** Fall from height (axial loading); 10% bilateral; 10% associated with lumbar spine fracture

**Bohler's angle:**
- Measured on lateral calcaneus X-ray
- Line from posterior tuberosity apex to highest point of posterior articular facet, then to highest point of anterior process
- Normal: 20-40°
- Reduced (&lt;20°) = calcaneal fracture with articular depression

**Gissane's (Critical) Angle:**
- Within the calcaneus body; normal ~120-140°; increased in fractures

**CT:** Essential for surgical planning; shows subtalar joint involvement

### 5th Metatarsal Fractures

**Zone 1 — Avulsion fracture:**
- Base of 5th MT avulsion by peroneus brevis
- Mechanism: inversion injury
- Transverse fracture at base of 5th MT
- Treatment: weight-bearing as tolerated; heals well

**Zone 2 — Jones Fracture:**
- Transverse fracture at metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction (specific zone)
- Risk of non-union (avascular zone)
- Treatment: non-weight-bearing; may need surgical fixation for athletes

**Zone 3 — Proximal Diaphyseal Stress Fracture:**
- Stress fracture in proximal diaphysis
- Risk of non-union; surgical fixation often required

**Mnemonic:** Jones fracture is at the junction (metaphyseal-diaphyseal)

### Lisfranc Injury

**Definition:** Disruption of the tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint

**Mechanism:** Direct crush or indirect (fall from horse, foot plantarflexed)

**Radiographic features:**
- 2nd metatarsal base should align medial border of middle cuneiform
- Fracture at base of 2nd metatarsal (avulsion from Lisfranc ligament) = pathognomonic
- Weight-bearing X-rays: diastasis between 1st and 2nd MT bases >2 mm
- CT: essential for full characterization

**Importance:** Frequently missed; chronic injury causes post-traumatic flat foot

## 34.2 Ankle Fractures

### Weber Classification (AO)

Based on fibular fracture level relative to syndesmosis:

| Type | Fibular Fracture Level | Syndesmosis |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **A** | Below syndesmosis | Intact |
| **B** | At level of syndesmosis | Variable |
| **C** | Above syndesmosis | Disrupted |

**Significance:** Higher Weber type = greater syndesmotic disruption = greater instability = more likely to need surgery

### Lauge-Hansen Classification

Based on mechanism of injury:
- Supination-Adduction (SA)
- Supination-External Rotation (SER) — most common (45%)
- Pronation-Abduction (PA)
- Pronation-External Rotation (PER)

### Bimalleolar and Trimalleolar Fractures

**Bimalleolar:** Medial and lateral malleolus fractured

**Trimalleolar:** Bimalleolar + posterior malleolus (Volkmann fragment — posterior tibial plafond)
- Posterior malleolus: if >25% articular surface → surgical fixation

### Mortise Assessment

**Key measurements on mortise view:**
- Medial clear space (MCS): should be &lt;4 mm (equal to superior clear space)
- Tibiofibular overlap: should be &gt;10 mm on mortise view
- Widened MCS = deltoid ligament rupture (or medial malleolus fracture)

## 34.3 Tibial Fractures

### Tibial Plateau Fractures

**Schatzker Classification:**
- Type I: Lateral plateau split (low energy)
- Type II: Lateral plateau split-depression
- Type III: Lateral plateau pure depression
- Type IV: Medial plateau fracture (high energy; vascular injury risk)
- Type V: Bicondylar
- Type VI: Metaphyseal-diaphyseal dissociation

**CT:** Always required for preoperative planning

**Associated injuries:** Peroneal nerve, popliteal artery, meniscal tears

**MRI:** For associated soft tissue injuries (PCL, LCL, menisci)

### Tibial Shaft Fractures

- High energy; compartment syndrome risk
- Intramedullary nailing standard treatment

## 34.4 Femur Fractures

### Femoral Neck Fractures

**Incidence:** Predominantly elderly women with osteoporosis

**Garden Classification:**
| Type | Description | AVN Risk |
|------|-------------|----------|
| I | Incomplete, valgus impacted | Low |
| II | Complete, non-displaced | Low |
| III | Complete, partially displaced | Moderate |
| IV | Complete, fully displaced | High |

**AVN risk:** Garden III-IV → disruption of retinacular blood supply → AVN of femoral head

**Radiographic features:**
- AP and cross-table lateral (not frog-leg lateral)
- Fracture line through femoral neck
- Impacted valgus (Garden I): subtle; trabeculae compacted

**Management:**
- Garden I-II: Internal fixation (dynamic hip screw)
- Garden III-IV: Hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty (elderly)

### Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures

- Between greater and lesser trochanters (extracapsular)
- Lower AVN risk than femoral neck
- Evans classification: stable vs. unstable
- Treatment: Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or intramedullary nail

### Subtrochanteric Fractures

- Below lesser trochanter
- High rate of non-union
- Treatment: Long intramedullary nail

### Femoral Shaft Fractures

- High energy
- May lose 1-2 liters blood (compartment or thigh)
- Fat embolism risk
- Treatment: Intramedullary nail

## 34.5 Hip Fractures in the Elderly

### Epidemiology

- Major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly
- 1-year mortality: 15-30%
- Predominantly female (osteoporosis)
- Female:male ratio 3:1

### Occult Hip Fracture

- Clinical suspicion + negative X-ray
- MRI within 24-48 hours (most sensitive)
- If MRI unavailable: CT or bone scan
- Missed diagnosis can lead to displacement and worse outcomes

### Periprosthetic Fractures

- Fracture around a hip prosthesis
- Vancouver classification
- Complex management involving revision arthroplasty in many cases

## Key Points Summary

1. **Calcaneal fracture** — Bohler's angle &lt;20° is diagnostic; CT essential for surgical planning; look for associated lumbar fracture

2. **Jones fracture** at metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of 5th MT — high non-union risk; compare to benign zone 1 avulsion

3. **Weber C** ankle fracture — above syndesmosis; syndesmosis always disrupted; usually requires surgical fixation

4. **Garden III-IV** femoral neck fracture — high AVN risk; prefer arthroplasty in elderly

5. **Lisfranc injury** — commonly missed; diastasis >2 mm between 1st and 2nd MT on weight-bearing views; CT for full assessment

6. **Occult hip fracture** — MRI most sensitive; must not miss in elderly patient with hip pain after fall
