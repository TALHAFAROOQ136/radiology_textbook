# Chapter 32: Approach to Skeletal Trauma

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the ABCS mnemonic for systematic fracture evaluation
- Describe a fracture using standard radiological terminology
- Classify fractures by pattern, displacement, and angulation
- Differentiate open from closed fractures
- Recognize fracture healing and its complications

---

## 32.1 ABCS Mnemonic for Fracture Evaluation

Systematic approach prevents missed injuries:

**A — Alignment**
- Assess bony alignment and articular congruency
- Look for dislocation, subluxation
- Check joint spaces

**B — Bone Density and Architecture**
- Normal bone density? (osteoporosis, metastases, Paget's)
- Cortical integrity: cortical disruption?
- Trabecular pattern: abnormal lucencies or sclerosis?

**C — Cartilage/Joint Space**
- Joint space width (narrowed = arthritis)
- Cartilage thickness (assessed by joint space on X-ray)
- Effusion (joint swelling)

**S — Soft Tissues**
- Soft tissue swelling
- Subcutaneous emphysema (open injury)
- Foreign bodies
- Fat pad displacement (elbow, knee)
- Periosteal reaction

## 32.2 Fracture Description — Standard Terminology

### Location

**Within the bone:**
- Epiphysis (joint surface)
- Physis (growth plate — in children)
- Metaphysis (flared region near growth plate)
- Diaphysis (shaft)

**Position:**
- Proximal, mid, or distal third
- Specific anatomical regions (e.g., femoral neck, radial head)

### Pattern

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transverse** | Perpendicular to long axis; usually from direct force |
| **Oblique** | Diagonal line; angulating forces |
| **Spiral** | Helical; from twisting/rotational force |
| **Comminuted** | Three or more fragments; high-energy trauma |
| **Segmental** | Two fractures creating an isolated segment |
| **Greenstick** | One cortex broken, one bent; children |
| **Buckle (torus)** | Cortical buckling without complete break; children |
| **Impacted** | Fragments driven together; axial loading |
| **Avulsion** | Fragment pulled off by tendon or ligament |
| **Stress** | From repetitive loading; no single traumatic event |

### Displacement

**Displacement** = how much the distal fragment has moved relative to the proximal:
- Described as % of shaft diameter (e.g., 50% displaced)
- Direction: anterior, posterior, medial, lateral
- Shortening or distraction

### Angulation

- Angle between the axis of the two fragments
- Described in degrees
- Direction: valgus (lateral apex), varus (medial apex), anterior, posterior
- **"Apex"** refers to direction the apex of the angle points (where fracture "bows")

### Rotation

- Rotational deformity of the distal fragment
- Assessed clinically (rotation of foot relative to leg, etc.)

### Complete vs. Incomplete

- **Complete:** Fracture extends across the entire bone
- **Incomplete:** One cortex intact (greenstick, buckle, stress fracture)

---

## 32.3 Fracture Classification Systems

### By Relationship to Skin

**Closed (simple):** Skin intact over fracture
- Low infection risk
- Conservative or surgical management options

**Open (compound):** Skin broken, fracture communicates with environment
- High infection risk
- Requires emergency irrigation and debridement
- Gustilo-Anderson classification (I, II, III by wound size and contamination)

### General Anatomical Classifications

Many specific fractures have named classifications:
- **Colles fracture:** Distal radius; dorsal angulation
- **Smith fracture:** Distal radius; volar angulation ("reverse Colles")
- **Barton fracture:** Intra-articular distal radius
- **Salter-Harris:** Physeal (growth plate) fractures in children

---

## 32.4 Open vs. Closed Fractures

### Open Fracture Signs on Imaging

- Subcutaneous emphysema (gas in soft tissues on X-ray or CT)
- Wound communication visible clinically
- Soft tissue swelling and disruption

### Gustilo-Anderson Classification (Open Fractures)

| Grade | Wound Size | Contamination | Tissue | Prognosis |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| I | &lt;1 cm | Minimal | Minimal | Good |
| II | 1-10 cm | Moderate | Moderate | Good |
| IIIa | >10 cm | High | Extensive | Moderate |
| IIIb | >10 cm | High | Periosteal stripping | Poor |
| IIIc | Any | High | Vascular injury requiring repair | Worst |

## 32.5 Fracture Healing and Complications

### Normal Fracture Healing Stages

| Stage | Time | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Inflammatory | 0-2 weeks | Hematoma formation; inflammation |
| Soft callus | 2-6 weeks | Fibrocartilage and woven bone |
| Hard callus | 6-12 weeks | Lamellar bone replacing woven bone |
| Remodeling | Months-years | Callus remodeling to cortical bone |

### Radiographic Signs of Healing

- **Periosteal new bone (callus):** First visible ~10-14 days (earliest X-ray sign)
- Bridging callus: fracture line bridged by callus
- Disappearing fracture line
- Cortical continuity re-established
- Remodeling: smooth cortical contour

### Complications of Fractures

**Early complications:**
- Neurovascular injury (nearby vessels and nerves)
- Compartment syndrome (increased intracompartmental pressure → ischemia)
- Fat embolism (especially femoral shaft fractures)

**Late complications:**

| Complication | Radiographic Feature |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Malunion** | Fracture healed with deformity |
| **Non-union** | Fracture not healed by expected time; persistent fracture line; sclerotic margins; no bridging callus |
| **Delayed union** | Slower than expected but still healing |
| **Avascular necrosis (AVN)** | Bone death; sclerosis, then collapse |
| **Osteomyelitis** | Bone destruction, periosteal reaction, sequestrum/involucrum |
| **Post-traumatic arthritis** | Intra-articular fracture → joint space narrowing |
| **Growth plate arrest** | Premature closure of physis in children |

### Non-Union Types

**Hypertrophic non-union:**
- Adequate blood supply but insufficient stability
- "Elephant foot" callus at fracture ends
- Treatment: Fixation

**Atrophic non-union:**
- Inadequate blood supply
- No callus; fracture ends osteopenic, rounded
- Treatment: Bone graft + fixation

## Key Points Summary

1. **ABCS** — systematic approach: Alignment, Bone density, Cartilage/joints, Soft tissues

2. **Fracture description:** Location, pattern, complete/incomplete, displacement (%), angulation (degrees/direction), rotation

3. **Open fractures** — skin disrupted; emergency treatment; Gustilo-Anderson grading

4. **First X-ray sign of healing:** Periosteal callus (10-14 days)

5. **Non-union:** Persistent fracture line with sclerotic margins; no bridging callus; either hypertrophic or atrophic

6. **Compartment syndrome** — clinical diagnosis; extreme pain, tense compartment; requires fasciotomy
