# Chapter 37: Joint Disorders

## Learning Objectives

- Identify osteoarthritis on plain radiographs using the four key features
- Recognize rheumatoid arthritis imaging patterns and differentiate from OA
- Describe joint effusion on X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI
- Classify shoulder and hip dislocations and their complications
- Recognize septic arthritis on imaging

---

## 37.1 Osteoarthritis (OA)

### Pathology

Degenerative joint disease with:
- Articular cartilage loss
- Subchondral bone changes
- Osteophyte formation
- Synovial thickening

### Radiographic Features — "LOSS"

**L — Loss of joint space:**
- Non-uniform narrowing (worst in load-bearing areas)
- Medial compartment of knee (most common)
- Superior joint space of hip

**O — Osteophytes:**
- Bony outgrowths at joint margins
- Bridging osteophytes in advanced disease

**S — Subchondral Sclerosis:**
- Increased density of bone beneath articular cartilage
- "Eburnation" — polished, ivory-like appearance in end-stage

**S — Subchondral Cysts (Geodes):**
- Small lucent cysts beneath the articular surface
- Formed by synovial fluid forced into subchondral bone through cartilage defects

### Distribution Patterns

| Site | Distribution | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Knee | Medial > lateral > patellofemoral | Weight-bearing |
| Hip | Superior joint space narrowing | Axial loading |
| Hand/Wrist | DIP > PIP > 1st CMC joint | "Heberden's nodes" at DIP |
| Spine | Facet joints; disc degeneration | Spondylosis |

**Heberden's nodes:** Osteophytic nodules at DIP joints
**Bouchard's nodes:** Osteophytic nodules at PIP joints

### Primary vs. Secondary OA

- Primary: No identifiable underlying cause
- Secondary: Post-traumatic, post-infectious, metabolic (gout, CPPD), avascular necrosis

---

## 37.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

### Pathology

Autoimmune synovitis → pannus formation → cartilage and bone erosion

### Radiographic Features — "LESS SPACE"

**L — Loss of joint space (uniform):**
- Symmetric narrowing (unlike OA which is asymmetric)

**E — Erosions:**
- Marginal erosions at "bare areas" (not covered by cartilage)
- "Mouse ear" erosions at ulnar styloid
- Progress to "pencil-in-cup" in advanced disease

**S — Soft tissue Swelling:**
- Periarticular swelling (fusiform swelling)

**S — Subchondral osteopenia:**
- Juxta-articular osteoporosis (periarticular)
- Differs from OA (which has sclerosis)

**SPACE (vs. OA):**
- OA has Sclerosis, RA does NOT

### Distribution

- **Hands:** MCP and PIP joints (DIP spared — unlike OA)
- **Bilateral and symmetric**
- **Wrist:** Radiocarpal, intercarpal erosions; carpal crowding
- **Foot:** MTP joints; hallux valgus
- **Large joints:** Knee, shoulder, hip

### RA vs. OA Comparison

| Feature | Rheumatoid Arthritis | Osteoarthritis |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Distribution | MCP, PIP (spares DIP) | DIP > PIP (spares MCP) |
| Symmetry | Bilateral symmetric | Asymmetric |
| Joint space | Uniform loss | Non-uniform |
| Bone density | Juxta-articular osteopenia | Normal or sclerosis |
| Erosions | Yes (marginal) | No (osteophytes instead) |
| Osteophytes | Absent | Present |

### Cervical Spine in RA

- **Atlantoaxial subluxation:** ADI >3 mm on lateral flexion X-ray (instability)
- Odontoid erosion → C1-C2 instability
- Subaxial subluxation: "step-ladder" appearance

---

## 37.3 Crystal Arthropathy

### Gout (Monosodium Urate Crystals)

**Distribution:** MTP (1st, big toe most common), ankle, knee, wrist

**Radiographic features:**
- **"Rat bite" erosions:** Punched-out erosions with overhanging edge (distinguishes from RA)
- Periarticular soft tissue swelling
- **Tophi:** Soft tissue deposits of urate crystals; may calcify
- Late: narrowing and destruction
- Early disease: X-ray may be normal

**CT:** Dense tophi visible as white deposits
**Ultrasound:** "Double contour sign" — urate crystal deposition on articular cartilage

### Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition (CPPD/Pseudogout)

**Distribution:** Knee (most common), wrist, hip, symphysis pubis

**Radiographic features:**
- **Chondrocalcinosis:** Calcification within cartilage (menisci, triangular fibrocartilage, articular cartilage)
- Linear calcifications in joint cartilage
- Associated OA-like changes in unusual locations (patellofemoral, radiocarpal)

---

## 37.4 Joint Effusions

### Knee Effusion

**Plain X-ray:**
- Suprapatellar soft tissue density (blurring of prefemoral fat pad)
- Displacement of quadriceps fat pad
- "Ballottable" patella

**Ultrasound:**
- Anechoic or hypoechoic fluid in suprapatellar bursa
- Assessment for internal echoes (hemarthrosis, inflammatory)

**MRI:**
- T2-weighted: High signal fluid
- Best for associated pathology (meniscal, cruciate tears)

### Elbow Effusion

- Posterior fat pad visible = joint effusion (always abnormal)
- Anterior fat pad: normally small; "sail sign" when elevated

### Hip Effusion

- Widening of joint space on AP X-ray (subtle)
- Ultrasound: best for hip effusion; guides aspiration

---

## 37.5 Dislocations

### Shoulder Dislocation

**Anterior (95%):**
- Humeral head displaced anterior and inferior to glenoid
- Mechanism: external rotation + abduction
- X-ray: AP view — humeral head below coracoid process
- Y-view: humeral head anterior to Y-junction
- Axillary view: humeral head anterior to glenoid

**Complications:**
- Bankart lesion: Anteroinferior glenoid rim fracture (bony Bankart = avulsion of anterior inferior glenoid)
- Hill-Sachs lesion: Posterior humeral head impaction defect (from impact on glenoid)
- Rotator cuff tear (especially elderly)
- Axillary nerve injury (deltoid weakness)

**Posterior dislocation (&lt;5%):**
- Often missed clinically
- Mechanism: seizure, electric shock, forced internal rotation
- X-ray: AP — "lightbulb sign" (humeral head appears round due to fixed internal rotation)
- "Vacant glenoid" sign
- "Trough line" sign: vertical line of impaction defect on humeral head

### Elbow Dislocation

- Most common in children and young adults
- Posterior dislocation (90%)
- X-ray: Radius and ulna displaced posteriorly relative to humerus
- Associated: Radial head fracture (Mason I-II); medial epicondyle avulsion

### Hip Dislocation

**Posterior (90%):**
- Mechanism: Dashboard injury (force along femoral shaft with hip flexed)
- Limb: Shortened, internally rotated, adducted
- X-ray: Femoral head superior and lateral to acetabulum
- Associated: Posterior acetabular wall fracture; sciatic nerve injury (foot drop)
- Emergency reduction within 6 hours (AVN risk increases with delay)

**Anterior (&lt;10%):**
- Limb: Externally rotated, abducted
- Femoral head inferior and medial

## 37.6 Septic Arthritis

### Clinical Urgency

Septic arthritis is an emergency — joint destruction occurs within hours-days.

### Imaging

**X-ray (early):**
- Often normal in first days
- Periarticular soft tissue swelling
- Joint space widening (effusion)
- Late: Rapid cartilage destruction → uniform loss of joint space; periarticular osteopenia; then bone erosions

**Ultrasound:**
- Joint effusion (may show internal echoes — pyarthrosis)
- Real-time guided joint aspiration

**MRI:**
- T2: High signal effusion; synovial enhancement
- Bone marrow edema (secondary osteomyelitis)
- Best for soft tissue extent

**Nuclear medicine (bone scan):**
- Increased uptake on all three phases
- Useful when X-ray and US equivocal

### Joint Aspiration

- Definitive: Gram stain + culture
- WBC >50,000 cells/μL + >90% neutrophils = highly suspicious
- Do NOT inject corticosteroids before aspiration
