## 39.1 Systematic Approach to Bone Lesions

### Key Questions for Any Bone Lesion

1. **Patient age:** Most tumors occur in specific age groups
2. **Location:** Which bone? Which part of the bone (epiphysis, metaphysis, diaphysis)?
3. **Borders:** Sharp (zone of transition) or ill-defined?
4. **Matrix:** Calcification pattern? Ossification?
5. **Periosteal reaction:** Type and pattern
6. **Soft tissue component:** Extension beyond bone?

### Zone of Transition

**Zone of transition** = where the lesion merges with normal bone

- **Narrow (well-defined):** Slowly growing; benign
- **Wide (ill-defined):** Aggressive; possibly malignant

### Periosteal Reactions

| Type | Pattern | Significance |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Solid** | Single solid new bone layer | Benign, slow process |
| **Laminated ("onion skin")** | Multiple parallel layers | Aggressive (Ewing's sarcoma) |
| **Codman's triangle** | Periosteum elevated at tumor edge | Aggressive, malignant |
| **Sunburst** | Spiculated radiating pattern | Highly aggressive (osteosarcoma) |
| **Hair-on-end** | Perpendicular spicules | Malignant (also in bone marrow expansion) |

### Bone Matrix

**Calcified matrix (cartilage):**
- "Rings and arcs" — C-shaped calcifications
- Fluffy, cloud-like — malignant cartilage tumors

**Ossified matrix (bone within lesion):**
- Dense, "ivory-like" — osteosarcoma
- Well-organized trabeculae — fibrous dysplasia

### Age Groups and Tumor Type

| Age | Likely Tumors |
|-----|--------------|
| &lt;5 years | Neuroblastoma metastases |
| 10-25 years | Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, chondroblastoma |
| 20-40 years | Giant cell tumor, fibrous dysplasia |
| >40 years | Metastases (most common), myeloma, chondrosarcoma |

## 39.2 Benign Bone Lesions

### Osteochondroma (Exostosis)

**Most common benign bone tumor**

**Location:** Metaphysis of long bones (distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus)
**Age:** Children and young adults

**Radiographic features:**
- Bony outgrowth from cortex
- Continuous cortex and medullary canal with parent bone (key distinguishing feature)
- Cartilage cap at tip (may calcify)
- Pedunculated (stalk) or sessile (broad base)
- Points away from joint

**Multiple osteochondromas:** Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) — autosomal dominant; higher sarcoma risk

**Malignant transformation risk:**
- Solitary: &lt;1%
- Multiple (HME): 3-5%
- Suspect if cartilage cap >2 cm in adult (MRI)

### Giant Cell Tumor (GCT)

**Location:** Epiphysis of long bones (distal femur, proximal tibia, distal radius — "around the knee")
**Age:** 20-40 years (skeletally mature)

**Radiographic features:**
- **Epiphyseal** location (reaches articular surface)
- **Eccentric** within bone
- "Soap bubble" appearance (internal trabeculation)
- No matrix mineralization
- Narrow zone of transition but no sclerotic margin
- Cortical expansion

**CT/MRI:**
- Fluid-fluid levels (secondary ABC formation)
- Locally aggressive; may recur after curettage

### Enchondroma

- Benign cartilage tumor within medullary cavity
- Common in hands (phalanges)
- Rings and arcs calcification within bone
- Treatment: usually none; curette if painful/pathological fracture risk

### Fibrous Dysplasia

- Fibrous tissue replacing normal bone
- "Ground glass" matrix (hazy, lucent appearance)
- Bowing deformity ("shepherd's crook" deformity of proximal femur)
- Usually asymptomatic; may cause pathological fracture

### Unicameral Bone Cyst (Simple Bone Cyst)

- Fluid-filled cyst
- Metaphysis of humerus or femur
- Children 5-15 years
- "Fallen leaf sign": Pathological fracture; cortical fragment falls to dependent wall of cyst
- Treatment: Aspiration/injection or curettage

## 39.3 Malignant Bone Tumors

### Osteosarcoma

**Most common primary malignant bone tumor in children/adolescents (10-25 years)**

**Location:** Metaphysis; distal femur (50%), proximal tibia, proximal humerus ("around the knee")

**Radiographic features:**
- Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion
- **Sunburst periosteal reaction** — highly specific
- **Codman's triangle** — periosteal elevation at tumor margin
- Dense "ivory-like" tumor bone within lesion
- Soft tissue mass

**Types:**
- Conventional (90%): High-grade, osteoblastic/chondroblastic/fibroblastic
- Parosteal: Low-grade; on posterior distal femur; dense ossified mass
- Periosteal: Intermediate grade; periosteal surface

**Staging:**
- MRI: Local extent, skip lesions (within same bone)
- CT Chest: Pulmonary metastases
- Bone scan: Bone metastases

### Ewing's Sarcoma

**Second most common malignant bone tumor in children**
**Age:** 10-20 years (adolescents); "Round cell tumor"

**Location:** Diaphysis of long bones (femur, tibia, fibula); flat bones (pelvis, ribs, scapula)

**Radiographic features:**
- Permeative "moth-eaten" lytic lesion
- **Onion skin (laminated) periosteal reaction** — characteristic
- Large soft tissue mass (often disproportionately large)
- Diaphyseal location

**Staging:** MRI (local) + CT Chest + bone scan/PET-CT

### Chondrosarcoma

**Most common primary malignant bone tumor in adults (40-60 years)**

**Location:** Pelvis, proximal femur, ribs, scapula; long bone metaphysis/diaphysis

**Radiographic features:**
- Lobular, expanding mass
- Cartilage matrix: "rings and arcs" calcification (fluffy, endosteal)
- Endosteal scalloping of cortex (&gt;2/3 cortical thickness = aggressive)
- Soft tissue component in high-grade

**Grade:** Low (I), intermediate (II), high (III) — higher grade = worse prognosis

### Bone Metastases

**Most common malignant bone tumor (by far) in adults >40 years**

**Primary sources ("top 5 common + 2 rare"):**
- Lung, Breast, Prostate, Kidney, Thyroid (commonly "BLT and KT")

**Type:**
- **Lytic** (destructive): Kidney, thyroid, lung, breast, myeloma
- **Sclerotic** (blastic): Prostate, breast (can be mixed), carcinoid, lymphoma
- **Mixed:** Breast (most common mixed), lung

**Radiographic features:**
- Multiple lesions (usually)
- No periosteal reaction (unless pathological fracture present)
- Spine: Vertebral body involvement most common
- "Winking owl sign": Absent pedicle on AP X-ray (destruction of one pedicle) → suspicious for metastasis

**Bone scan (scintigraphy):**
- Sensitive for osteoblastic metastases
- May miss purely lytic (myeloma, thyroid, renal)

## 39.4 Osteomyelitis

### Pathogenesis

**Routes of infection:**
1. **Hematogenous** (most common in children): Bacteremia seeds metaphysis (most vascular)
2. **Direct inoculation:** Open fracture, surgery, puncture wound
3. **Contiguous spread:** Soft tissue infection spreading to bone

**Most common organism:** Staphylococcus aureus

### Acute Osteomyelitis

**Radiographic features (X-ray):**
- Often NORMAL in first 7-14 days
- Earliest: Periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling
- Later: Lytic bone destruction; permeative pattern

**MRI (gold standard for early detection):**
- T1: Low signal marrow (replacement of fat by edema/pus)
- T2/STIR: High signal in medullary cavity
- Enhancing after contrast
- Soft tissue involvement
- Detects infection within 3-5 days of onset

**Bone scan:**
- Hot spot (3-phase bone scan): All 3 phases increased
- Sensitive early
- Poor specificity

### Chronic Osteomyelitis

**Radiographic features:**
- Sequestrum: Dead bone (dense, surrounded by lytic zone) within the infection
- Involucrum: New periosteal bone surrounding the infected zone (reactive)
- Cloaca: Opening in cortex where pus drains
- Sclerosis and cortical thickening

**MRI:**
- Sinus tracts (low T1, high T2)
- "Burrowing" abscess
- Adjacent soft tissue changes

### Brodie's Abscess

- Localized form of chronic subacute osteomyelitis
- Well-defined lytic lesion in metaphysis with sclerotic rim
- "Penumbra sign" on MRI: Low T1 signal zone within the high signal edema = abscess granulation tissue
- Common in tibial metaphysis

### Vertebral Osteomyelitis / Discitis

- Disc space infection spreads to adjacent vertebral endplates
- **Earliest sign:** Endplate erosion and disc space narrowing
- MRI: T1 low signal in disc and adjacent vertebrae; T2 high signal; enhancing with contrast
- Complication: Epidural abscess (MRI urgently if neurological signs)

## 39.5 Distinguishing Tumor from Infection

| Feature | Tumor | Osteomyelitis |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Location | Metaphysis (most) | Metaphysis (hematogenous) |
| Soft tissue | Mass | Inflammatory edema |
| Adjacent joint | Usually spared | Often involved (septic arthritis) |
| Disc/joints (spine) | Disc preserved in metastases | Disc destroyed in discitis |
| MRI enhancement | Peripheral (necrotic core) | Diffuse throughout |
| Temperature/WBC | Variable | Usually elevated |
| Sinus tract | Absent | May be present (chronic) |

**Biopsy:** Often required for definitive diagnosis

## Key Points Summary

1. **Zone of transition:** Narrow = benign; wide = aggressive/malignant

2. **Osteochondroma** — continuous cortex and medulla with parent bone; points away from joint; malignant transformation rare (&lt;1% solitary)

3. **GCT** — epiphyseal, eccentric, "soap bubble"; in skeletally mature patients 20-40 years

4. **Osteosarcoma** — sunburst periosteal reaction + Codman's triangle; distal femur/proximal tibia; 10-25 years

5. **Ewing's sarcoma** — onion-skin periosteal reaction; diaphysis; large soft tissue mass; 10-20 years

6. **Sequestrum + Involucrum** = pathognomonic of chronic osteomyelitis

7. **Metastases** — most common malignant bone lesion in adults >40; prostate = sclerotic; renal/thyroid = lytic
