# Chapter 9: Skeletal Positioning — Upper Extremities

## Learning Objectives

- Position patients correctly for hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder radiographs
- Identify standard and supplementary views for upper extremity imaging
- Explain the clinical indications for each view
- Recognize normal anatomy on upper extremity radiographs

---

## 9.1 Hand and Finger Positioning

### PA Hand

**Indications:** Fractures, arthritis, foreign bodies, soft tissue swelling

**Positioning:**
1. Patient seated at side of table
2. Hand placed palm-down (pronated) on cassette
3. Fingers slightly spread and extended
4. Wrist in same plane as hand
5. Central ray perpendicular, centered at 3rd MCP joint

**Shows:** All metacarpals, phalanges, carpal bones (partially), MCP and IP joints

### Oblique Hand

**Positioning:**
- Hand rotated 45° (semipronated position)
- Fingers parallel to cassette
- Central ray at 3rd MCP joint

**Shows:** Metacarpals and phalanges without overlap; useful for 4th and 5th metacarpal fractures

### Lateral Hand

**Positioning:**
- Hand in lateral position (ulnar side down)
- Fingers extended and stacked
- Central ray at 2nd MCP joint

**Shows:** Palmar/dorsal displacement of fractures; useful for mallet finger

### Individual Finger Views

**PA and lateral** of single finger:
- Center to the specific finger
- Provides more detail than whole-hand view
- Often requested for specific digit trauma

## 9.2 Wrist Positioning

### PA Wrist

**Indications:** Wrist fractures, carpal injuries, Colles fracture

**Positioning:**
1. Hand pronated on cassette
2. Wrist and forearm in same plane
3. Slight ulnar deviation may help see radial styloid
4. Central ray perpendicular to joint space

**Shows:** Distal radius and ulna, all 8 carpal bones, carpometacarpal joints

**Normal wrist angles:**
- Radial inclination: ~22°
- Volar tilt: ~11°

### Lateral Wrist

**Positioning:**
- Ulnar side down
- Elbow flexed 90°
- Wrist in true lateral position (thumb up)
- Central ray at mid-wrist

**Shows:** Volar/dorsal displacement; colles fracture angulation; lunate dislocation

**Normal:** Capitate-lunate-radius should align in a straight line on true lateral

### Scaphoid Views

**Indications:** Clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture with normal PA wrist

**Standard Scaphoid View:**
- PA wrist in ulnar deviation (moves scaphoid from under distal radius)
- OR: PA with 30° tube angulation toward elbow
- Central ray centered over scaphoid (anatomical snuffbox)

**Why important:** Scaphoid fractures often occult on standard views; 20% of fractures missed on initial X-ray

**Note:** If scaphoid fracture suspected and X-ray negative — MRI is the gold standard for detection

## 9.3 Forearm Positioning

### AP Forearm

**Positioning:**
1. Patient seated, arm extended on table
2. Hand supinated (palm up)
3. Elbow extended
4. Central ray midway between wrist and elbow

**Shows:** Radius and ulna in full length; both wrist and elbow joints on the image

### Lateral Forearm

**Positioning:**
- Elbow flexed 90°
- Hand in lateral position
- Forearm on table, ulnar side down
- Central ray midway between joints

**Shows:** Lateral view of radius and ulna; dorsal/volar fracture displacement

---

## 9.4 Elbow Positioning

### AP Elbow

**Positioning:**
1. Patient seated, arm extended and supinated
2. Elbow fully extended (may not be possible in trauma)
3. Elbow on cassette
4. Central ray perpendicular at joint space (medial and lateral epicondyles)

**Shows:** Distal humerus, radial head, olecranon, joint space

**Modified AP if cannot extend:**
- Two separate views: AP distal humerus + AP proximal forearm
- Central rays parallel to respective bones

### Lateral Elbow

**Positioning:**
- Elbow flexed 90°
- Hand in lateral (thumb up) position
- Elbow resting on table
- Central ray at lateral epicondyle

**Shows:** Anterior and posterior fat pads; radial head, capitulum; distal humerus

**Fat pad sign:**
- Anterior fat pad visible normally
- Posterior fat pad visible ONLY when elbow joint is distended (hemarthrosis, fracture)
- Elevated anterior fat pad ("sail sign") suggests effusion and likely fracture

### Radial Head View

**Indication:** Suspected radial head fracture when standard views are negative

**Positioning:**
- Lateral position but with elbow flexed only 45°
- Beam angled 45° toward shoulder
- Projects radial head free of coronoid process overlap

---

## 9.5 Shoulder Positioning

### AP Shoulder (Internal and External Rotation)

**Indications:** Shoulder fractures, dislocation, rotator cuff calcification, arthritis

**AP External Rotation:**
- Arm at side, externally rotated 45° (palm forward)
- Shows greater tuberosity in profile on lateral humeral head
- Central ray at coracoid process

**AP Internal Rotation:**
- Arm internally rotated (palm backward)
- Shows lesser tuberosity in profile
- Hill-Sachs lesion (postero-lateral humeral head defect) may be visible
- Central ray at coracoid process

### Y-View (Scapular Y View)

**Indication:** Best view for detecting shoulder dislocation type

**Positioning:**
- Patient rotated 40–60° (affected shoulder toward cassette)
- Scapula in true lateral — glenoid, acromion, and coracoid form a "Y" shape
- Central ray at humeral head

**Interpretation:**
- Normal: humeral head centered in the "Y" (at junction of arms)
- Anterior dislocation: humeral head anterior to glenoid (below coracoid on Y)
- Posterior dislocation: humeral head posterior to glenoid

### Axillary View

**Indications:** Shoulder dislocation, glenoid fractures, Hill-Sachs lesion

**Positioning (standard):**
1. Patient seated
2. Arm abducted 70–90° (resting on support)
3. Cassette above shoulder
4. Horizontal beam from below, through axilla
5. Central ray at glenohumeral joint

**Alternative (trauma-modified):**
- Arm needs only 45° abduction
- Called "Trauma Axillary" or "Velpeau Axillary"
- Patient leans over cassette placed on table

**Shows:** Glenohumeral joint from below; glenoid in profile; anterior/posterior dislocation

### Clavicle Positioning

**AP Clavicle:**
- Supine or erect
- Central ray 15–20° cephalad angulation
- Projects clavicle above rib cage

**AP Oblique Clavicle:**
- 15–20° cephalad and 15° medial angulation
- Better visualization of mid-clavicle fractures

### Scapula Positioning

**AP Scapula:**
- Patient rotated 15–20° toward affected side
- Arm abducted and internally rotated
- Shows scapular body away from rib cage

**Lateral Scapula:**
- Patient rotated with affected side toward cassette (same as Y-view)
- True lateral view of scapular body

### Acromioclavicular (AC) Joints

**Indications:** AC joint separation (Rockwood classification)

**Bilateral AP AC joints:**
- Both AC joints on same film for comparison
- Erect position (weight of arms stresses AC joints)
- May need stress views with 10 lb weights held

## Key Points Summary

1. **PA wrist in ulnar deviation** is the key view for visualizing the scaphoid; negative X-ray with clinical suspicion requires MRI

2. **Posterior fat pad sign** on lateral elbow X-ray indicates joint effusion and likely occult fracture, even with negative routine views

3. **Y-view (scapular Y)** is essential for identifying shoulder dislocation type — normal humeral head sits at Y-junction

4. **Axillary view** is required for complete shoulder assessment; trauma-modified version allows imaging with minimal arm movement

5. **Colles fracture** — distal radius with dorsal angulation and radial shortening; described on PA + lateral wrist views

6. **Hill-Sachs lesion** — posterolateral humeral head impaction defect after anterior dislocation; seen on internal rotation AP view
