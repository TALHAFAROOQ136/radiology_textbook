# Chapter 10: Skeletal Positioning — Lower Extremities

## Learning Objectives

- Position patients correctly for foot, ankle, tibia, knee, and femur radiographs
- Identify standard and supplementary views for lower extremity imaging
- Explain the clinical indications for each position
- Recognize key anatomical landmarks on lower extremity radiographs

---

## 10.1 Foot and Toe Positioning

### AP (Dorsoplantar) Foot

**Indications:** Foot fractures, foreign bodies, arthritis, foot deformity

**Positioning:**
1. Patient seated on table with knee flexed
2. Foot flat on cassette
3. Central ray angled 10° posteriorly (toward heel), centered at 3rd metatarsal base
4. This angulation reduces foreshortening of metatarsals

**Shows:** All metatarsals, phalanges, tarsal bones (partially), TMT joints

### Oblique Foot

**Positioning:**
- Foot rotated medially 30–45° (medial side elevated)
- Medial oblique is standard
- Central ray perpendicular at 3rd TMT joint

**Shows:** 3rd-5th metatarsal bases (Jones fracture at 5th MT base), cuboid, lateral tarsal area without overlap

### Lateral Foot

**Positioning:**
- Patient in lateral position (lateral side of foot on cassette)
- Foot in true lateral
- Central ray perpendicular at mid-foot level

**Shows:** Calcaneus, talus in profile; midfoot, forefoot in lateral projection; calcaneal pitch angle

### Calcaneus Views

**Axial (Harris-Beath view):**
- Foot dorsiflexed (patient pulls toes back with a strap)
- Heel on cassette
- Beam angled 40° from vertical (along long axis of foot)
- Shows: Calcaneal body and subtalar joint from below

**Lateral calcaneus:**
- True lateral view of calcaneus
- Böhler's angle can be measured (normal 20–40°; reduced in calcaneal fracture)

## 10.2 Ankle Positioning

### AP Ankle

**Indications:** Ankle fractures (Ottawa Ankle Rules), ligament injury, arthritis

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine or seated with leg extended
2. Ankle in dorsiflexion (90°)
3. Midsagittal plane of leg perpendicular to cassette
4. Central ray perpendicular, centered at tibiotalar joint (midway between malleoli)

**Shows:** Tibiotalar joint, both malleoli, distal fibula

**Note:** True AP with some external rotation shows the ankle mortise differently from the mortise view

### Mortise View (Oblique AP)

**Indication:** Best view for ankle fracture assessment; shows mortise (bony ring of ankle)

**Positioning:**
- Same as AP ankle but foot internally rotated 15–20°
- This brings fibular malleolus out of overlapping position
- Entire mortise (medial, superior, and lateral joint space) is visible

**Interpretation:**
- Medial clear space: should be &lt;4 mm (widening suggests deltoid ligament rupture)
- Superior clear space: should be uniform
- Tibiofibular overlap: reduced if syndesmosis disrupted

### Lateral Ankle

**Positioning:**
- Patient in lateral position (lateral side of ankle on cassette)
- True lateral (medial and lateral malleoli superimposed)
- Central ray perpendicular at medial malleolus

**Shows:** Lateral view of talus, tibiotalar joint, Achilles tendon shadow, calcaneus

---

## 10.3 Tibia and Fibula

### AP Tibia/Fibula

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine, leg extended
2. Foot slightly dorsiflexed and internally rotated slightly
3. Central ray perpendicular, centered midway along tibia/fibula
4. Include both ankle and knee joints

### Lateral Tibia/Fibula

**Positioning:**
- Knee and hip slightly flexed
- Lateral side of leg on cassette
- Central ray at midpoint of leg

**Shows:** Overlapping tibia and fibula in profile; medullary canal

---

## 10.4 Knee Positioning

### AP Knee

**Indications:** Knee fractures, arthritis, effusion, patella assessment

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine, leg extended
2. Slight internal rotation (3–5°) to correct for normal knee anatomy
3. Central ray perpendicular at tibial plateau (1 cm below apex of patella)
4. May be taken erect for joint space measurement

**Shows:** Distal femur, proximal tibia and fibula, patella, medial and lateral joint spaces

### Lateral Knee

**Positioning:**
- Patient in lateral position (lateral side down)
- Knee flexed 20–30° (or as patient tolerates)
- Central ray perpendicular at medial tibial plateau

**Shows:** Femoral condyles, patellofemoral joint, tibial plateau in profile, fat pad

**Fat pad sign:** Hoffa's fat pad and prefemoral fat pad visible; displacement suggests effusion

**Suprapatellar joint space:** Normally should be congruent; effusion shows as soft tissue density

### Patella Views

**AP/PA Tangential (Sunrise/Merchant View):**

**Sunrise View:**
- Patient seated, knee flexed over end of table
- Cassette held below knee
- Beam directed from above through patellofemoral joint
- Shows patellofemoral joint; patellar maltracking; fractures

**Merchant View (more reproducible):**
- Patient supine, knees bent 45° over table end
- Bilateral tangential view of both patellofemoral joints
- Shows: Q-angle, patellar tilt, subluxation

### Tunnel View (Intercondylar Notch View)

**Indication:** Detect loose bodies in intercondylar notch; osteochondral defects

**Positioning:**
- Patient prone, knee flexed 40°
- Or PA with knee on cassette
- Beam angled 40° caudally
- Shows intercondylar (intercondyloid) fossa without overlap

**Also called:** Notch view, Camp-Coventry method

### Erect Knee (Weight-Bearing)

**Indication:** True joint space measurement for osteoarthritis severity

**Positioning:**
- Patient erect, weight bearing on both legs
- AP view
- Bilateral comparison

**Shows:** True articular cartilage loss (narrowing under load); better than non-weight bearing

---

## 10.5 Femur Positioning

### AP Femur

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine
2. Leg extended and internally rotated 15–20° (same as hip)
3. Must include hip joint above and knee joint below
4. Two cassettes may be needed for tall patients

### Lateral Femur

**Positioning:**
- Patient in lateral position
- Knee slightly flexed
- Lateral side of thigh on cassette
- Central ray midway along femoral shaft

---

## 10.6 Special Views

### Long Leg (Full Leg) View

**Indication:** Limb length discrepancy; lower limb alignment for surgical planning

**Positioning:**
- Patient erect, weight-bearing
- Both lower limbs included on one long film
- Includes hips, knees, and ankles
- Digital X-ray allows stitching of multiple images

**Measurements:**
- Mechanical axis (femoral head to center of ankle) — should pass through center of knee
- Varus/valgus alignment

### Whole Leg Radiograph

Used pre-operatively for:
- Tibial and femoral osteotomies
- Total knee replacement planning
- Assessment of tibial/femoral bowing

## Key Points Summary

1. **Mortise view** (15–20° internal rotation) is the key ankle view for assessing the ankle mortise and detecting syndesmotic injury

2. **Medial clear space** on mortise view should be &lt;4 mm; widening indicates deltoid ligament rupture or medial mortise injury

3. **Böhler's angle** on lateral calcaneus (normal 20–40°) is reduced in calcaneal fracture

4. **Merchant/Sunrise view** of the patellofemoral joint is essential for evaluating patellar maltracking and subluxation

5. **Weight-bearing knee** radiographs are required for accurate joint space measurement in osteoarthritis

6. **Ottawa Ankle Rules** guide the decision to perform ankle and foot radiographs after trauma
