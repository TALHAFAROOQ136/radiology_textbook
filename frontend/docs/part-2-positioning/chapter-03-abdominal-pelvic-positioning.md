# Chapter 8: Abdominal and Pelvic Positioning

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the standard positions for abdominal and pelvic radiography
- Identify the indications for erect and decubitus abdominal views
- Explain the technical considerations for optimal abdominal imaging
- Position the patient correctly for pelvis and hip radiographs

## 8.1 Supine Abdominal Radiograph (KUB)

### What is KUB?

**KUB** = **K**idneys, **U**reters, **B**ladder — the original name for a plain abdominal radiograph. Despite the name, all abdominal organs are assessed, including the bowel gas pattern, solid organs, and calcifications.

### Indications

- Bowel obstruction (initial assessment)
- Urinary calculi (though CT is more sensitive)
- Foreign body ingestion/retention
- Abdominal pain assessment (limited utility)
- Assessment of surgical clips, drains, stents
- Abdominal mass assessment (limited)

### Patient Positioning

**Position:** Supine (AP projection)

**Steps:**
1. Patient lies supine on the radiographic table
2. Arms at sides or on chest (not over abdomen)
3. Legs extended and together, no rotation
4. Midsagittal plane perpendicular to table (equal distance from each side)

**Central Ray:**
- Directed perpendicular to the film
- Centered at the iliac crests (approximately L3-L4)
- Alternatively, centered at umbilicus

**Field of View:**
- Include from diaphragm (xiphoid process) superiorly
- Include symphysis pubis inferiorly
- Include lateral abdominal walls
- Two exposures may be needed for tall patients

**Technical Factors:**
- kVp: 70–80 kVp (lower than chest to visualize soft tissue)
- mAs: adjusted for patient size
- Suspended respiration (end expiration)

### Normal Anatomy on KUB

- Gas pattern: stomach (left upper), small bowel (central), large bowel (peripheral)
- Liver shadow: right side
- Spleen shadow: left side
- Psoas muscle margins: bilateral paravertebral
- Kidneys: typically at T12-L3 level
- Bladder: in pelvis (may be visible if distended)
- Symphysis pubis and iliac wings

## 8.2 Erect Abdominal Radiograph

### Purpose

The erect (upright) abdominal view is primarily used to detect:
- **Free intraperitoneal air (pneumoperitoneum)** — gas under the diaphragm
- **Air-fluid levels** — suggests bowel obstruction or ileus

### Patient Positioning

**Position:** Erect (standing or sitting), AP projection

**Steps:**
1. Patient stands or sits upright (minimum 5–10 minutes to allow air to rise)
2. Cassette or detector at back
3. Arms at sides
4. Central ray at level of iliac crests

**Key Points:**
- Must wait adequate time for air to accumulate under diaphragm (5–10 min upright)
- Include both hemidiaphragms on the image (critical for detecting free air)
- If patient cannot stand, use a sitting erect position

**Alternative:** If patient cannot stand or sit, use left lateral decubitus (see below)

### Detecting Free Intraperitoneal Air

On erect view:
- Free air appears as a crescent of black (gas) beneath the diaphragm
- More common on right (right hemidiaphragm more definitive landmark)
- Right-sided free air >1 cm is significant
- As little as 1 mL of free air can be detected with proper technique

**Sensitivity:** Erect CXR is MORE sensitive than erect AXR for subdiaphragmatic free air (use both)

---

## 8.3 Left Lateral Decubitus View

### Indications

- Patient unable to stand erect
- Detection of free intraperitoneal air
- Assessment of air-fluid levels in bowel

### Positioning

**Position:** Patient lies on LEFT side (left side down), horizontal beam X-ray

**Steps:**
1. Patient in left lateral position (left side on table)
2. Wait 5–10 minutes for free air to migrate to right side (highest point)
3. Horizontal beam directed from front to back (cross-table lateral)
4. Include right hemidiaphragm and right lateral abdomen

**Why left side down?**
- Gastric bubble (left side) doesn't confuse with free air on right
- Free air collects on the right side between liver and right lateral abdominal wall
- A clear separation between liver and abdominal wall = free air

**Alternative:** Right lateral decubitus — patient on right side; free air collects on left

## 8.4 Pelvic Radiograph — AP View

### Indications

- Hip fracture (elderly patients with falls)
- Pelvic fracture (trauma)
- Sacroiliac joint assessment
- Acetabular assessment
- Pre-operative planning for hip replacement

### Positioning

**Position:** Supine, AP projection

**Steps:**
1. Patient supine, flat on table
2. Lower limbs extended and internally rotated 15–20° (brings femoral neck parallel to film)
3. Internal rotation can be maintained with sandbags between feet
4. Toes should be together and medially rotated
5. Midsagittal plane centered to table

**Central Ray:**
- Perpendicular to film
- Centered midway between ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) and symphysis pubis
- Approximately 5 cm (2 inches) above symphysis pubis

**Field of View:**
- Entire pelvis: iliac crests superiorly, ischial tuberosities inferiorly
- Lateral to acetabula
- Both hips and proximal femora

**Note:** Gonadal shielding was traditionally used; current ACR guidance recommends against routine shielding as it may obscure anatomy.

### Anatomy on Pelvic AP View

- Iliac wings (ilium)
- Sacrum and coccyx
- Sacroiliac joints (bilaterally)
- Acetabula and femoral heads
- Greater and lesser trochanters
- Obturator foramina
- Pubic symphysis

## 8.5 Pelvic Inlet and Outlet Views

Used for detailed assessment of pelvic ring fractures.

### Inlet View (AP axial — caudal tilt)

**Purpose:** Assess AP diameter of pelvic ring; detects anteroposterior displacement

**Positioning:**
- Supine patient
- Central ray angled 35–40° caudally (toward feet)
- Centered at ASIS level

**Shows:** Pelvic ring as a more circular structure; good for assessing AP disruption

### Outlet View (AP axial — cranial tilt)

**Purpose:** Assesses vertical displacement; detects superior/inferior displacement

**Positioning:**
- Supine patient
- Central ray angled 20–35° cephalically (toward head)
- Centered at symphysis

**Shows:** Sacrum in profile; pubic rami, sacral foramina visible

---

## 8.6 Hip Positioning

### AP Hip View

Similar to AP pelvis but focused on one hip:
- Same positioning as pelvis
- Collimate to include: proximal femur, entire acetabulum, femoral head
- 15–20° internal rotation of affected limb

### Frog-Leg Lateral (Lauenstein Method)

**Indication:** Assessment of femoral head position; follow-up for hip pathology; avoid where fracture is suspected

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine
2. Affected hip and knee flexed to approximately 90°
3. Hip externally rotated (thigh dropped outward — "frog leg" position)
4. Foot rests on opposite knee or table
5. Central ray perpendicular to film, centered at femoral neck

**Provides:** True lateral view of proximal femur and femoral head

**Contraindication:** Do NOT use if hip fracture is suspected (positioning will cause pain and may displace fracture)

### Axiolateral Hip (Cross-Table Lateral)

**Indication:** Suspected hip fracture — does not require moving the fractured hip

**Positioning:**
1. Unaffected hip and knee flexed and elevated out of the way (supported by person or pillow)
2. Injured limb in neutral position on table
3. Horizontal beam directed from medial to lateral across the hip
4. Cassette/detector against lateral aspect of injured hip (held vertically)

**Best used when:** Hip fracture is suspected and frog-leg lateral is contraindicated

## Key Points Summary

1. **KUB** (supine abdominal radiograph) assesses bowel gas pattern, solid organs, and calcifications

2. **Erect abdominal radiograph** detects free intraperitoneal air as a crescent beneath the diaphragm; patient must be upright for ≥5 minutes

3. **Left lateral decubitus** is used when patient cannot stand; horizontal beam detects free air between liver and right abdominal wall

4. **Pelvic AP view** requires 15–20° internal rotation of legs to bring femoral neck parallel to detector

5. **Frog-leg lateral hip** is contraindicated in suspected hip fracture; use axiolateral (cross-table lateral) instead

6. **Pelvic inlet and outlet views** add to AP pelvis for detailed fracture assessment
