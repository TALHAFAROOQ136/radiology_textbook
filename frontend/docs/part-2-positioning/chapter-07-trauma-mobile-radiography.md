- Understand mobile (portable) radiography principles and limitations
- Apply C-spine clearance imaging principles

## 12.1 Trauma Radiography Protocols

### Primary Trauma Survey Imaging

In major trauma, imaging follows the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) protocol:

**Initial trauma series (X-rays in the trauma bay):**
1. AP Chest (portable)
2. AP Pelvis
3. Lateral C-spine (if not going directly to CT)

These three X-rays can be obtained rapidly without moving the patient.

### CT in Major Trauma

Modern trauma centers often proceed directly to CT rather than plain X-rays for major trauma patients:

**Trauma CT ("pan-scan" or "whole-body CT"):**
- CT Head (non-contrast)
- CT Cervical Spine
- CT Chest (with contrast)
- CT Abdomen and Pelvis (with contrast)
- Can be completed in &lt;5 minutes

**Advantages over X-ray:**
- More sensitive for injuries
- No patient movement required (except onto CT table)
- Three-dimensional reconstruction possible

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher radiation dose
- Patient must be transported to CT scanner
- Requires haemodynamic stability

### Trauma X-Ray Principles

- **Never move the patient** into uncomfortable or dangerous positions
- Radiation safety staff should clear the area before exposure
- Use horizontal beam where possible to minimize patient movement
- Document any limitations (e.g., "patient could not be fully positioned due to cervical collar")

## 12.2 Cross-Table Lateral Technique

### Principle

The **cross-table lateral** technique uses a **horizontal X-ray beam** directed across the patient while they remain supine. This allows lateral images without rolling the patient.

**Key applications:**
- Lateral cervical spine in trauma
- Lateral hip in suspected hip fracture
- Lateral knee when patient cannot flex
- Hip and pelvis assessment

### Cross-Table Lateral Cervical Spine

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine with suspected C-spine injury (in cervical collar)
2. DO NOT remove collar or move neck
3. Horizontal beam directed from lateral side of neck
4. Cassette/detector on opposite side of neck, held vertically
5. Pull shoulders down (not the neck) to visualize C7-T1

**Interpretation:**
- All 7 cervical vertebrae must be visible (including C7-T1)
- If C7-T1 not seen: swimmer's view or CT

**Limitations:**
- Cannot replace full C-spine series
- X-ray alone insufficient for C-spine clearance in obtunded patients

### Cross-Table Lateral Hip

**Indications:** Suspected hip fracture (cannot do frog-leg lateral)

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine, injured hip in neutral position
2. Unaffected hip and knee flexed and elevated (supported)
3. Horizontal beam from medial to lateral
4. Cassette held vertically against lateral aspect of injured hip

**Shows:** Femoral neck in profile; detects femoral neck fracture angulation and displacement

## 12.3 Horizontal Beam Radiography

### Uses

- Detection of fluid levels (bowel obstruction, joints)
- Detection of free air (pneumoperitoneum on erect or decubitus)
- Air-fluid levels in sinuses (Water's view with horizontal beam)
- Lateral views without patient movement

### Technique

- X-ray beam is directed horizontally (parallel to floor)
- Film/detector is placed vertically beside the patient
- Gravity causes air to rise and fluid to fall — creating diagnostic air-fluid levels
- Works best when patient is upright or in decubitus position for ≥5 minutes

### Sinus Views with Horizontal Beam

**Indication:** Air-fluid levels in sinuses (acute sinusitis, trauma)

- Standard Water's view (upright) uses horizontal beam
- Fluid levels in maxillary sinuses visible
- CT has largely replaced this for sinus pathology

## 12.4 Mobile (Portable) X-Ray

### When Mobile Radiography is Used

- Patients too unstable for transport to radiology
- Intensive care unit (ICU) patients on ventilators
- Post-operative patients in recovery
- Emergency department trauma bays
- Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
- Operating theatres

### Equipment

**Mobile X-ray machines:**
- Battery-powered or plug-in portable units
- Digital (CR or DR) detectors for immediate image review
- C-arm fluoroscopy for operative guidance

### Limitations of Portable Radiography

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| AP projection only | Different anatomy angles vs. PA |
| Short focal-film distance | Image magnification |
| Less penetration | May not penetrate large patients adequately |
| No Bucky grid always | Increased scatter, reduced contrast |
| Patient position variable | Rotation, lordosis |

### AP vs. PA Chest X-Ray

**Standard (PA):** Patient stands at cassette; tube behind patient
- True PA projection
- Less cardiac magnification
- Better quality

**Portable (AP):** Tube in front; patient lying/sitting
- Cardiac size appears larger (magnification)
- Clavicles appear higher
- Mediastinum wider
- Must note "AP portable" on request form

**Clinical implication:** Do NOT diagnose cardiomegaly on AP portable CXR without comparison to PA CXR

### ICU Chest X-Ray Review

Systematic approach to portable ICU CXR:

1. **Technical quality:** Rotation? Adequate inspiration?
2. **Tubes and lines:**
   - Endotracheal tube: 5 cm above carina (neutral position)
   - Central venous lines: tip in SVC, above right atrium
   - Nasogastric tube: below diaphragm in stomach
   - Chest tubes: position relative to pneumothorax or effusion
   - PICC line: tip in SVC/lower
3. **Lungs:** Consolidation, atelectasis, pneumothorax, effusion
4. **Heart:** Size (limited on AP)
5. **Mediastinum:** Width
6. **Bones:** Rib fractures, clavicle

## 12.5 C-Spine Clearance Imaging

### Goal

To exclude clinically significant cervical spine injury in trauma patients.

### Methods

#### Clinical Clearance (No Imaging Required if ALL Met)

**NEXUS Criteria (validated):**
1. No midline cervical tenderness
2. No focal neurological deficit
3. Normal level of consciousness
4. No intoxication
5. No distracting injury

If all 5 criteria met → C-spine injury very unlikely → can clinically clear without imaging

**Canadian C-Spine Rule (high-risk and low-risk factors):**
- More complex; used to decide if X-ray or CT needed
- More specific than NEXUS for certain populations

#### X-ray C-Spine Series (3-View)

1. Lateral (must include C7-T1)
2. AP
3. Open-mouth odontoid

**Sensitivity:** 85–90% (NOT adequate to clear C-spine in obtunded patients)

**Must see all 7 vertebrae:** If C7-T1 not seen → swimmer's view or CT

#### CT Cervical Spine

**Indications:**
- Obtunded patient (unable to cooperate with clinical exam)
- High-energy mechanism (MVA, fall from height)
- X-ray inadequate (cannot see C7-T1)
- Abnormal or equivocal X-ray
- High clinical suspicion despite normal X-ray

**Sensitivity:** >99% for cervical fractures

**Limitations:** May miss pure ligamentous injuries (no fracture, but instability)

#### MRI Cervical Spine

**Indications:**
- Neurological deficit with negative CT
- High clinical suspicion of ligamentous injury with negative CT
- Suspected cord contusion/hematoma
- Pre-operative planning

## Key Points Summary

1. **Trauma survey X-rays:** AP Chest, AP Pelvis, and Lateral C-spine — performed rapidly without moving patient significantly

2. **Cross-table lateral** uses horizontal beam to image patient in supine position — essential for C-spine and hip assessment in trauma

3. **Portable AP chest** appears different from PA — cardiac size magnified, mediastinum wider; do not over-call findings

4. **C-spine clearance:** NEXUS criteria can safely exclude injury clinically in cooperative patients; CT needed for obtunded patients

5. **CT is more sensitive than X-ray** for cervical fractures (>99% vs. ~85–90%)

6. **MRI is needed** for ligamentous injury assessment when CT is negative but clinical suspicion remains
