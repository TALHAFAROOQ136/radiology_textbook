- Identify special views including odontoid and oblique projections
- Explain flexion-extension views and their indications
- Recognize normal spinal alignment and anatomy on radiographs

---

## 11.1 Cervical Spine

### AP Cervical Spine

**Indications:** Cervical fracture, disc disease, spondylosis, rheumatoid arthritis (C1-C2 subluxation)

**Positioning:**
1. Patient erect (standing or sitting) or supine (trauma)
2. Neck in slight extension to open joint spaces
3. Central ray angled 15–20° cephalad (to project mandible above C3-C4)
4. Centered at thyroid cartilage (C4-C5 level)

**Shows:** C3-T1 (upper cervicals obscured by mandible), uncovertebral joints, spinous processes

### Lateral Cervical Spine

**Most important single view of the cervical spine**

**Positioning:**
1. Patient erect, arm at side (shoulder depressed — pull arms down if patient can cooperate)
2. Neck in neutral position
3. True lateral (no rotation)
4. Central ray horizontal at C4 (thyroid cartilage)
5. Include C7-T1 junction (crucial — must see all 7 cervical vertebrae)

**Why C7-T1 must be seen:**
- Fractures and subluxations frequently occur at cervicothoracic junction
- If C7-T1 not seen, the lateral is incomplete (swimmer's view required)

**Normal alignment on lateral:**
- Anterior vertebral line (smooth curve)
- Posterior vertebral line (smooth curve)
- Spinolaminar line (smooth curve)
- Disc spaces: uniform height
- Facet joints: smooth overlap

### Open-Mouth (Odontoid) View

**Indications:** C1-C2 fractures, odontoid fracture, atlantoaxial subluxation (rheumatoid arthritis)

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine or erect
2. Mouth opened wide (maximally)
3. Central ray perpendicular, directed through open mouth
4. Includes occiput superiorly and C2 inferiorly

**Shows:** Dens (odontoid process) of C2, C1 (atlas) ring, lateral masses of C1, C1-C2 articulations

**Key measurements:**
- Space between dens and each C1 lateral mass: should be equal bilaterally
- Atlantodens interval (ADI): anterior dens to anterior arch of C1 — normal &lt;3 mm adults, &lt;5 mm children

### Oblique Cervical Spine

**Indications:** Neural foramina assessment; nerve root compression

**Positioning:**
- Patient rotated 45° from AP (can be done as PA or AP)
- Right posterior oblique (RPO): right intervertebral foramina visible
- Left posterior oblique (LPO): left foramina visible
- Two views done as a pair

**Shows:** Neural foramina in profile (one side per view); pedicles; articular pillars

### Swimmer's View (Cervicothoracic Lateral)

**Indication:** Visualization of C7-T1 junction when standard lateral cannot show it

**Positioning:**
1. Patient lateral
2. Arm closest to film extended overhead (swimmer's position)
3. Opposite arm pulled down toward feet
4. Horizontal beam through C7-T1 junction
5. Alternative: 5° caudal tilt may help

**Shows:** C6-T2 in lateral projection when upper shoulder obscures this on standard lateral

---

## 11.2 Thoracic Spine

### AP Thoracic Spine

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine or erect
2. Arms at sides
3. Central ray perpendicular at T6-T7 (midsternum or xiphoid)
4. Include T1 superiorly and T12 inferiorly

**Technical challenge:** Wide density range between mediastinum and lungs requires:
- Use of anode-heel effect (position anode toward feet — less exposure at neck/T1)
- Gradient filter or digital manipulation

**Shows:** Vertebral bodies, disc spaces, pedicles, paraspinal soft tissues

### Lateral Thoracic Spine

**Positioning:**
- Patient in true lateral position
- Arms raised above head (or folded at chest)
- Knees slightly flexed for stability
- Central ray at T7 (inferior angle of scapula)

**Shows:** Vertebral body heights, disc spaces, anterior/posterior vertebral lines; kyphosis

**Kyphosis assessment:**
- Cobb angle measured between T2 and T12
- Normal thoracic kyphosis: 20–45°

---

## 11.3 Lumbar Spine

### AP Lumbar Spine

**Indications:** Low back pain (with red flags), scoliosis, fractures, disc disease, spondylolisthesis

**Positioning:**
1. Patient supine, hips and knees flexed (reduces lumbar lordosis)
2. Midsagittal plane perpendicular to table
3. Central ray perpendicular at L3 (level of iliac crests)
4. Include T12 superiorly and sacrum inferiorly

**Shows:** L1-L5 vertebrae, intervertebral disc spaces, pedicles, transverse processes, sacroiliac joints

**Scoliosis on AP:**
- Cobb angle measured from endplates of end vertebrae
- Coronal curve is visible

### Lateral Lumbar Spine

**Positioning:**
- Patient in lateral decubitus position
- Hips and knees flexed for stability
- Pillow under head (keeps spine horizontal)
- Central ray at L3 (iliac crest level)

**Shows:** Vertebral body heights, disc spaces, foramina, spondylolisthesis, listhesis grade

**Spondylolisthesis grading (Meyerding):**
- Grade I: &lt;25% slip
- Grade II: 25–50%
- Grade III: 50–75%
- Grade IV: 75–100%
- Grade V (spondyloptosis): complete fall-off

### Oblique Lumbar Spine

**Indications:** Suspected spondylolysis (pars defect), facet joint disease

**Positioning:**
- Patient rotated 45° from AP
- "Scottie dog" sign visible on oblique
- Right posterior oblique (RPO): shows right pars interarticularis
- Done in pairs (bilateral obliques)

**"Scottie Dog" sign:**
- Ear = superior articular process
- Eye = pedicle
- Nose = transverse process
- Body = lamina
- Neck = pars interarticularis
- A "collar" or break at the neck = pars defect (spondylolysis)

## 11.4 Sacrum and Coccyx

### AP Sacrum

**Positioning:**
- Supine patient
- Central ray 15° cephalad (angled toward head)
- Centered at level 2–3 cm above symphysis pubis

**Shows:** Sacrum in profile without foreshortening; sacral foramina; S1-S5

### AP Coccyx

**Positioning:**
- Supine
- Central ray 10° caudad (angled toward feet)
- Centered lower than sacrum view

**Shows:** Coccyx projected below sacrum

### Lateral Sacrum and Coccyx

- Patient in true lateral
- Both sacrum and coccyx usually visible on one lateral view
- Central ray at posterior ASIS level

---

## 11.5 Flexion-Extension Views

### Indications

- Suspected cervical instability (rheumatoid arthritis, ligamentous injury)
- Post-operative assessment of fusion
- Chronic neck pain with instability concern
- C-spine clearance in certain trauma patients

### Cervical Spine Flexion-Extension

**Positioning:**
- Patient erect, seated or standing
- **Flexion view:** Maximum voluntary forward flexion; lateral beam
- **Extension view:** Maximum voluntary backward extension; lateral beam
- Patient moves head voluntarily (never forced)
- Trauma: supervised by physician; patient must be neurologically intact

**Measurements:**
- Atlantodens interval (ADI): normally &lt;3 mm; if &gt;3 mm in flexion = unstable
- Subluxation: any vertebra translating &gt;2 mm on adjacent = instability

### Lumbar Flexion-Extension

- Patient upright, lateral view in flexion then extension
- Shows abnormal motion between vertebrae
- Used for pre-operative assessment and post-fusion evaluation

## Key Points Summary

1. **All 7 cervical vertebrae must be visible** on lateral cervical spine; if C7-T1 obscured, swimmer's view required

2. **Open-mouth (odontoid) view** is essential for C1-C2 fracture and atlantoaxial subluxation assessment

3. **ADI** (atlantodens interval): normal &lt;3 mm adults; &lt;5 mm children — increased suggests C1-C2 instability

4. **"Scottie Dog" sign** on oblique lumbar view: pars defect ("collar") indicates spondylolysis

5. **Flexion-extension views** assess spinal instability — must be done voluntarily, never forced

6. **Spondylolisthesis** is graded on lateral lumbar view by degree of anterior vertebral body slip (Meyerding I-V)
