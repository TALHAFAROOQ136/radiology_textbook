# Chapter 13: Pediatric and Geriatric Positioning

## Learning Objectives

- Identify unique positioning challenges for pediatric patients
- Describe immobilization techniques and devices for children
- Apply dose reduction principles specifically for pediatric imaging
- Recognize geriatric-specific positioning adaptations

---

## 13.1 Pediatric Positioning Considerations

### Why Children Are Different

Pediatric patients are NOT small adults. Key differences include:

**Anatomical differences:**
- Proportionally larger head relative to body (affects positioning for chest/abdomen)
- Growth plates present (open physes — potential for injury with inappropriate positioning)
- Thymus visible in chest (can mimic mediastinal mass)
- Larger radiosensitivity (rapidly dividing cells, longer life expectancy)

**Behavioral differences:**
- Cannot follow instructions (infants, toddlers)
- Movement artifact is common
- Fear and anxiety affect cooperation
- Parental presence may be essential

**Technical implications:**
- Shorter exposure time needed (motion blur)
- Smaller field sizes
- Adjusted technique for smaller patient size

### Age-Specific Approaches

| Age Group | Key Challenges | Approach |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Newborn / Neonate (0-28 days) | Fragile; hypothermia risk | Warm blankets; NICU portable |
| Infant (1-12 months) | Cannot cooperate | Immobilization devices; fast exposure |
| Toddler (1-3 years) | Most difficult; resists | Parental holding; immobilization |
| Preschool (3-5 years) | Can understand simple instructions | Games; distraction |
| School-age (5-12 years) | Can cooperate well with reassurance | Explanation and reassurance |
| Adolescent (12+) | Approach as adult; consider privacy | Privacy; consent |

## 13.2 Immobilization Techniques

### Purpose

Immobilization allows imaging without sedation in many cases:
- Reduces motion artifact
- Reduces repeat exposures (lower radiation)
- Safer than sedation

### Manual Restraint by Parents/Carers

**Permissible when:**
- Parent understands and consents
- Parent wears lead apron
- Parent is not pregnant
- Parent has no recent significant radiation exposure

**Technique:**
- Parent holds child's arms above head (for chest X-ray)
- Parent holds head steady (for skull or facial views)
- Gentle but firm hold

**Note:** Staff should not hold unless necessary and wearing appropriate protection.

### Papoose Board (Pigg-O-Stat)

- Rigid board with velcro straps
- Child secured with arms extended above head
- Used for chest and abdominal views in infants
- Allows PA chest view (child stands inside device)

### Pigg-O-Stat

- Specialized device for infant chest radiography
- Clear Perspex tray with head support
- Child stands upright with arms elevated by the device
- Provides true PA chest view
- Most commonly used for infants 1-18 months

### Head Holders

- Foam or Velcro straps to stabilize skull
- Used for skull, facial, and sinus views

### Sandbags

- Heavy sandbags placed on limbs to reduce movement
- Not directly on the patient (risk of injury); on adjacent area to provide resistance

## 13.3 Radiation Dose Reduction in Pediatrics

### Why It Matters More in Children

- Children are 2-5x more radiosensitive than adults
- Longer life expectancy = more time for cancer to develop
- Gonads and bone marrow particularly sensitive

### Key Principle: Child-Sized Techniques

**Image Gently Campaign principles:**
1. **Child-size** the exposure (reduce mA and kVp to match child's size)
2. **Shield** gonads when not in primary beam
3. **One shot** — optimize positioning to avoid repeats
4. **Size** matters — know the child's weight and adjust protocols

### Technique Adjustment by Size

Instead of adult technique:
- Reduce mAs significantly for smaller children
- Automated exposure control (AEC) should be used
- Pediatric protocols programmed separately from adults
- DR/CR detectors allow lower dose than film-screen

### Specific Dose Reduction Measures

**kVp optimization:**
- Chest X-ray children: ~65-70 kVp (lower than adult 120 kVp)
- Lower kVp increases contrast but increases dose — balance carefully

**Collimation:**
- Strict collimation to region of interest
- Never use adult field size on a child

**Gonadal shielding:**
- Ovarian shielding (girls): when ovaries are near primary beam (pelvis, abdomen)
- Testicular shielding (boys): especially for hip/pelvis/abdomen
- NOTE: Current ACR guidance is evolving — shielding can sometimes obscure anatomy; clinical judgment required

**CT pediatric protocols:**
- Automatic tube current modulation
- Reduced kVp for smaller patients (80-100 kVp vs. 120-140 kVp in adults)
- Iterative reconstruction
- Image Gently CT protocols

### Alternatives to Ionizing Radiation

- **Ultrasound:** First choice for abdominal, renal, hip, and soft tissue pathology
- **MRI:** Preferred for brain, spine, and musculoskeletal in children (no radiation) — sedation may be needed
- **Fluoroscopy:** Minimize fluoroscopy time; use pulsed fluoroscopy

## 13.4 Common Pediatric Radiographic Studies

### Pediatric Chest X-Ray

**Normal variants in children:**
- Thymus: anterior mediastinal opacity; "sail sign" or "wave sign" — normal up to age 2-3
- Rounded lung opacities may represent atelectasis (not pneumonia)
- Respiratory motion common

**Positioning challenges:**
- Infant: Pigg-O-Stat or supine AP (PA preferred if possible)
- Toddler: AP supine or upright if can be positioned
- School-age: Same as adult (PA erect)

### Pediatric Hip Radiograph

**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH):**
- AP pelvis + frog-leg lateral
- Hilgenreiner line, Perkin line, acetabular index measured
- Ultrasound preferred in infants &lt;6 months (cartilaginous femoral head)

**Perthes Disease (avascular necrosis of femoral head):**
- AP and frog-leg lateral hip views
- Fragmentation, sclerosis, collapse of femoral head

### Scoliosis Studies in Children

- Full spine PA (standing) + lateral
- Monitor radiation dose — patients have repeated X-rays over years
- EOS system: full-body imaging at very low dose (1/10th conventional X-ray)
- Use PA rather than AP (reduces breast radiation dose significantly)

## 13.5 Geriatric Positioning Challenges

### Unique Considerations in Elderly Patients

**Anatomical changes:**
- Osteoporosis: fragile bones — handle gently; avoid forceful positioning
- Kyphosis: difficult to achieve neutral spine position
- Joint contractures: limited range of motion; cannot fully extend limbs
- Skin fragility: pressure from positioning devices causes bruising or tears

**Cognitive changes:**
- Dementia: cannot follow instructions; anxiety; agitation
- Need simple, clear, repeated instructions
- Familiar person present may help calm patient

**Mobility:**
- Many use walkers, wheelchairs, or are bed-bound
- Transfer to X-ray table may be difficult
- Consider portable X-ray if transfer is dangerous

### Modified Techniques for Elderly

**Chest X-ray:**
- PA erect if patient can stand
- If kyphotic: beam may need tilting
- Portable AP if patient cannot stand safely

**Hip X-ray:**
- May need modified AP view if contracture prevents positioning
- Cross-table lateral if frog-leg position impossible (arthritic/contracted hip)
- Document why standard positioning was not possible

**Lumbar spine:**
- Severe kyphosis: cannot achieve true AP/lateral
- Osteoporotic compression fractures common — document findings carefully
- Modified lateral with patient in wheelchair if necessary

**Extremity X-rays:**
- Joint contractures: cannot extend elbow or wrist fully
- Take best achievable position and document
- Two views at 90° to each other still the goal

### Osteoporosis Assessment

**DEXA Scan (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry):**
- Not a conventional radiograph — measures bone density
- Two sites: lumbar spine (PA) and hip
- T-score: compared to young normal adults
  - T-score &gt;-1.0: Normal
  - T-score -1.0 to -2.5: Osteopenia
  - T-score &lt;-2.5: Osteoporosis

**VFA (Vertebral Fracture Assessment):**
- Can be done on DEXA machine
- Lateral images of spine at low dose
- Detects vertebral compression fractures

## Key Points Summary

1. **Children are NOT small adults** — different anatomy, radiation sensitivity, and behavioral considerations

2. **Pigg-O-Stat** is the standard device for infant chest radiography, allowing true PA positioning

3. **Image Gently** principles: child-size technique, collimate carefully, shield when appropriate, avoid repeats

4. **Ultrasound and MRI** are preferred over X-ray in children wherever clinically appropriate

5. **Elderly patients** present with osteoporosis, contractures, and dementia — modified positioning and gentle handling required

6. **DEXA scan** is the gold standard for bone density measurement and osteoporosis diagnosis
