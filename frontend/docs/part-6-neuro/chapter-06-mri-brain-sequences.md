# Chapter 45: MRI Brain Sequences and Interpretation

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the clinical uses of each key MRI sequence
- Identify normal anatomy on T1-weighted MRI
- Use T2/FLAIR to detect pathology
- Explain DWI and ADC map interpretation
- Recognize gradient echo findings for hemorrhage
- Know when to order MRI vs. CT

## 45.1 T1-Weighted Imaging

### Characteristics

**T1-weighted images best show anatomy (gray matter vs. white matter).**

**Signal characteristics:**
| Structure | T1 Signal |
|-----------|----------|
| White matter | High (bright) — due to myelin |
| Gray matter | Intermediate |
| CSF | Low (dark) |
| Fat | Very high (bright) |
| Acute blood | Variable → Subacute = **Bright** |
| Gadolinium enhancement | Bright |

### Clinical Uses

1. **Anatomy:** Demonstrate normal brain architecture
2. **Subacute hemorrhage:** Methemoglobin is T1-bright (paramagnetic)
3. **Post-contrast enhancement:** Gadolinium shortens T1 → lesions enhance (appear bright)
4. **Fat:** Lipoma, dermoid — hyperintense
5. **Melanin:** Melanoma metastases — T1 bright
6. **Calcification:** Usually hypointense (but can vary)

### Post-Contrast T1

**Pathological enhancement requires breach of blood-brain barrier (BBB):**
- Tumors (GBM, metastases, meningioma, lymphoma)
- Infection (abscess ring, meningitis)
- Active demyelination (MS plaque)
- Subacute infarction (luxury perfusion, day 5-30)
- Arteriovenous malformations

## 45.2 T2-Weighted and FLAIR Imaging

### T2-Weighted Imaging

**Signal characteristics:**
| Structure | T2 Signal |
|-----------|----------|
| CSF | High (bright) |
| Edema | High (bright) |
| Gray matter | Intermediate-high |
| White matter | Intermediate-low |
| Cortical bone | Low (dark) |
| Air | Very low (dark) |
| Fibrous tissue | Low |

**T2 is sensitive for pathology because most pathological processes increase tissue water content → increase T2 signal**

**Uses:**
- Cerebral edema
- Infarction (after 6-12 hours)
- Tumor infiltration
- Demyelinating lesions (MS plaques)
- ILD, inflammation, infection

### FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery)

**CSF signal is suppressed (nulled):**
- Normal CSF = dark (unlike T2 where CSF = bright)
- This makes periventricular and cortical lesions MORE visible

**Key uses:**
- Periventricular MS plaques (more visible than T2 because CSF nulled)
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): FLAIR-bright SAH visible when CT borderline
- Cortical infarction
- Meningitis (abnormal sulcal signal)
- **DWI-FLAIR mismatch** for stroke timing (see Chapter 42)

**FLAIR may show CSF bright if:**
- High protein CSF (meningitis, SAH)
- Incomplete CSF nulling (artifact)
- Hemorrhage within CSF (SAH)

## 45.3 Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)

### Physical Principle

**Brownian motion** of water molecules:
- Normal brain: Random water motion (unrestricted)
- Ischemic or hypercellular tissue: Restricted water motion

**DWI signal:**
- High DWI = restricted diffusion OR T2 "shine-through"
- Must check ADC map to confirm restriction

**ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) Map:**
- Low ADC = restricted diffusion (TRUE restriction)
- High ADC = facilitated diffusion

**True restricted diffusion:** DWI high + ADC low

### Clinical Applications

| Condition | DWI Signal | ADC |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Acute infarction | High (bright) | Low (dark) |
| Abscess (pus) | High (bright) | Low (dark) |
| Hypercellular tumor (PCNSL, GBM) | High | Low |
| Epidermoid cyst | High (bright) | Low |
| Chronic infarction | Low | High |
| Edema | Variable | High |

### T2 "Shine-Through"

- High T2 signal causes high DWI signal regardless of diffusion
- If DWI high but ADC is ALSO high → NOT true restriction → T2 shine-through
- Always check BOTH DWI and ADC

## 45.4 Gradient Echo (GRE) and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI)

### Principle

Blood products (hemosiderin, deoxyhemoglobin) are paramagnetic → create local field disturbances → "blooming" artifact (appear larger than actual size)

### Blood Appearance on GRE/SWI by Age

| Stage | Blood Product | MRI Appearance |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Hyperacute (&lt;24h) | OxyHb | T2 high; GRE dark |
| Acute (1-3 days) | DeoxyHb | T2 dark; GRE dark |
| Early subacute (4-7 days) | MetHb (intracellular) | T1 bright; T2 dark |
| Late subacute (1-4 wk) | MetHb (extracellular) | T1 bright; T2 bright |
| Chronic (>4 wk) | Hemosiderin | T2 dark; GRE very dark (blooming) |

### Clinical Applications of GRE/SWI

1. **Cerebral microbleeds:** Tiny dark foci (hemosiderin); hypertension, CAA, DAI
2. **Cavernomas:** "Popcorn" appearance with dark hemosiderin halo
3. **DAI:** Multiple microhemorrhagic foci at gray-white junction, corpus callosum
4. **AVM:** Flow voids + hemosiderin
5. **Hemorrhagic transformation** of infarction

**SWI** is more sensitive than GRE for microbleeds.

## 45.5 Post-Contrast T1 Imaging

### Gadolinium Mechanisms

- Gadolinium shortens T1 relaxation time
- Blood-brain barrier (BBB) intact: No contrast in brain parenchyma (stays in vessels)
- BBB disrupted: Gadolinium leaks into tissue → enhances

### Types of Enhancement

| Pattern | Typical Pathology |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Solid homogeneous** | Meningioma, lymphoma |
| **Ring-enhancing** | GBM, abscess, metastasis, tumefactive MS |
| **Linear (leptomeningeal)** | Meningitis, carcinomatosis |
| **Subependymal** | Lymphoma, CMV, TB |
| **Curvilinear (gyral)** | Subacute infarct (luxury perfusion) |
| **Multiple nodular** | Metastases, abscesses |

## 45.6 When to Order MRI vs. CT

### CT is Preferred

| Scenario | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Acute trauma | Fast, detects blood, fractures |
| Acute stroke (exclude hemorrhage) | Rapid; available 24/7 |
| Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage | Fast and sensitive |
| Bone lesions | Superior bone detail |
| Pulmonary disease | CT better than MRI for lungs |
| Patient with MRI contraindication | Pacemaker, certain implants |

### MRI is Preferred

| Scenario | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Brain tumors | Superior soft tissue contrast |
| Spinal cord | MRI required (CT inadequate) |
| Acute stroke (definitive) | DWI most sensitive |
| White matter disease (MS) | FLAIR periventricular lesions |
| Posterior fossa pathology | No bone artifact |
| Posterior fossa, brainstem | CT artifact; MRI superior |
| Soft tissue tumors | Superior characterization |
| Bone marrow | MRI far superior |

### MRI Contraindications

**Absolute:**
- Cardiac pacemaker (unless MRI-conditional)
- Cochlear implants (unless MRI-conditional)
- Intraocular metallic foreign bodies
- Some cerebral aneurysm clips (depends on type)

**Relative:**
- First trimester pregnancy (avoid elective MRI; acceptable for urgent indication)
- Claustrophobia (open MRI or sedation may help)
- Metallic implants (assess type before scanning)
- Tattoos with metallic ink (can heat)

## Key Points Summary

1. **T1:** Anatomy; fat/myelin bright; subacute blood bright; gadolinium enhancement

2. **T2/FLAIR:** Pathology (high signal = edema, infarction, tumor, demyelination); FLAIR nulls CSF → better periventricular/cortical lesion detection

3. **DWI + ADC:** True restricted diffusion = DWI high + ADC low → acute ischemia, abscess, hypercellular tumor

4. **GRE/SWI:** Sensitive for blood products (hemosiderin "blooming"); microbleeds, DAI, cavernomas

5. **Blood-brain barrier disruption** allows gadolinium enhancement → tumors, infection, active demyelination, subacute infarction

6. **CT first for:** Acute trauma, hemorrhage exclusion, acute stroke; **MRI for:** Tumor, MS, spinal cord, posterior fossa, subacute stroke
