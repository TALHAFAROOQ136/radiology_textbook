## 43.1 Classification of Intracranial Hemorrhage

### By Location

| Type | Location | Common Cause |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Epidural hematoma** | Between skull and dura | Trauma (middle meningeal artery) |
| **Subdural hematoma** | Between dura and arachnoid | Trauma (bridging veins) |
| **Subarachnoid hemorrhage** | Within subarachnoid space | Aneurysm rupture; trauma |
| **Intraparenchymal** | Within brain tissue | Hypertension; CAA; AVM |
| **Intraventricular** | Within ventricles | Extension of SAH/IPH |
| **Mixed** | Multiple compartments | Severe trauma |

### CT Hounsfield Units for Blood

- Fresh blood: 50-80 HU (hyperdense)
- Subacute: Gradually becomes isodense (35-50 HU)
- Chronic: Hypodense (20-30 HU)

---

## 43.2 Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

### Epidemiology

- Incidence: ~9 per 100,000/year
- Peak age: 50-60 years
- Female predominance
- Case fatality: ~50% (including 10-15% before hospital)

### Clinical Presentation

- "Worst headache of my life" (thunderclap headache)
- Sudden onset at maximum severity
- May have brief LOC, neck stiffness, photophobia
- Sentinel headache: Warning leak (minor SAH before major rupture)

### CT Findings

**Sensitivity:** 98-100% within 12 hours; decreasing thereafter

**Findings:**
- Hyperdense blood in basal cisterns (interpeduncular, suprasellar, sylvian fissures)
- Pattern suggests aneurysm location:
  - ACoA (anterior communicating artery): Interhemispheric + subfrontal cisterns
  - MCA: Sylvian fissure (unilateral)
  - PCoA (posterior communicating): Basal cisterns ± temporal horn dilation

**Complications detected on CT:**
- Hydrocephalus (acute obstructive)
- Intraventricular extension
- Cerebral edema

### LP (Lumbar Puncture)

- If CT negative at >6-12 hours post-ictus
- Xanthochromia: Yellow discoloration of CSF (OxyHb + Bilirubin from blood breakdown)
- Xanthochromia develops 2-4 hours after SAH; peaks 12-24 hours; persists up to 2 weeks

### Aneurysm Localization

**CT Angiography (CTA):**
- First-line for aneurysm detection after SAH
- Sensitivity: 95-98% for aneurysms >3 mm
- Provides: Location, size, morphology, relationship to adjacent structures

**Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA):**
- Gold standard
- Required when CTA negative but SAH confirmed
- Therapeutic (coiling) at same session

**MR Angiography (MRA):**
- TOF MRA (no contrast)
- Used for screening or follow-up
- Less accurate than CTA for acute SAH workup

### Aneurysm Treatment

**Endovascular coiling:**
- Platinum coils placed within aneurysm sac via catheter
- Less invasive; now preferred for most aneurysms

**Surgical clipping:**
- Clip placed across aneurysm neck
- Better for certain complex aneurysms

### Complications of Aneurysmal SAH

**Vasospasm:**
- Peak: Days 4-14
- Can cause delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND)
- Monitoring: Transcranial Doppler (TCD), CTA/DSA if clinical deterioration
- Treatment: Triple-H therapy, nimodipine, angioplasty/intra-arterial vasodilators

**Hydrocephalus:**
- Acute (obstructive): Blood blocking CSF absorption
- Chronic communicating: Late (weeks-months)
- Treatment: External ventricular drain → VP shunt if persistent

**Rebleeding:**
- Highest risk in first 24 hours before treatment
- Secured with coiling/clipping urgently

## 43.3 Hypertensive Hemorrhage

### Mechanism

Chronic hypertension → lipohyalinosis of small perforating arteries → Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms → rupture

### Distribution ("PBTGC" mnemonic — deep structures)

**Classic locations:**
- **P**utamen (most common — 35%)
- **T**halamus (25%)
- **C**erebellum (10%)
- **P**ons (5%)
- **C**audate nucleus

**"BPTGC" sites are all deep, near perforating vessels**

### CT Features

- Acute hyperdense (white) intraparenchymal collection
- Round or oval
- Deep location (basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, cerebellum)
- Edema rim develops over hours
- May extend into ventricles (IVH) → worse prognosis
- Mass effect and midline shift

### Prognosis by Location

- Pontine hemorrhage: Highest mortality
- Putaminal: Variable
- Cerebellar: Surgical evacuation may be lifesaving

## 43.4 Vascular Malformations

### Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)

**Definition:** Abnormal connection between arteries and veins without capillary bed; high-flow

**Presentation:** Hemorrhage (50%); seizure; headache; neurological deficit

**CT:**
- Serpiginous hyperdense vascular channels (flow)
- Calcification in 25%
- Heterogeneous mass

**CTA/DSA:**
- Feeding arteries; nidus (tangle of abnormal vessels); draining veins
- Spetzler-Martin grade for surgical risk

**MRI:**
- "Flow voids" (signal loss) = high-flow
- SWI: Areas of blooming (hemosiderin from prior microbleeds)
- Nidus visible as tangle of vessels

### Cavernous Malformation (Cavernoma)

**Definition:** Dilated blood-filled sinusoids without normal brain between; no arteriovenous shunting; low-flow

**Presentation:** Seizure (most common); focal deficits; headache; incidental finding

**CT:**
- Often isoattenuating (hard to see)
- May show "popcorn" calcification
- No mass effect unless acutely hemorrhaged

**MRI (diagnostic):**
- T1: Mixed signal (blood products of different ages)
- **T2/SWI: "Popcorn" or "mulberry" appearance** — mixed signal core with dark blooming hemosiderin rim ("hemosiderin halo")
- SWI: Best for detecting multiple cavernomas
- No vascular flow voids (low-flow)

**CT vs. MRI:** CT may be negative; MRI definitive

### Developmental Venous Anomaly (DVA)

- Most common vascular malformation; usually incidental finding
- Umbrella of medullary veins draining into a large transcortical vein ("caput medusae")
- Benign; no treatment
- **MRI with contrast:** Classic "caput medusae" (head of Medusa) appearance of draining veins

### Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (DAVF)

- Abnormal connection between meningeal arteries and dural venous sinuses
- Risk of cortical venous reflux → venous hypertension → hemorrhage
- Pulsatile tinnitus is classic symptom
- DSA: Definitive diagnosis and classification

## 43.5 CTA and MRA for Aneurysm Detection

### Screening for Unruptured Aneurysms

**When to screen:**
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage survivors
- First-degree relatives of SAH patients (2+ affected family members)
- Polycystic kidney disease (10-15x increased aneurysm risk)
- Connective tissue disease (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos)

### Unruptured Aneurysm Management

**Risk of rupture by size:**
- &lt;7 mm: Low annual risk (~0.1-0.5%)
- 7-12 mm: ~0.5-1%
- &gt;12 mm: ~2-3% per year
- Giant (>25 mm): Higher risk

**Treatment decisions:** Based on size, location, morphology, patient age and risk tolerance

## Key Points Summary

1. **Aneurysmal SAH** — "worst headache of my life"; hyperdense basal cisterns on CT; CTA for aneurysm localization

2. **Xanthochromia** — develops 2-4 hours after SAH; LP required if CT negative at 6-12 hours

3. **Hypertensive ICH** — deep locations (putamen, thalamus, pons, cerebellum); round/oval hyperdense collection

4. **AVM** — serpiginous flow voids on MRI; CTA/DSA shows nidus and feeding vessels; high-flow

5. **Cavernoma** — "popcorn/mulberry" appearance on MRI; hemosiderin halo on T2/SWI; low-flow; no flow voids

6. **Vasospasm** — most dangerous SAH complication (days 4-14); monitoring with TCD; treatment with nimodipine
