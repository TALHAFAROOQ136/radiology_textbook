# Chapter 44: Brain Masses and Tumors

## Learning Objectives

- Classify primary brain tumors by WHO grade and imaging features
- Identify meningioma and differentiate from other extra-axial masses
- Recognize metastatic brain disease patterns
- Describe the ring-enhancing lesion differential diagnosis
- Describe MRI characteristics of common brain tumors

---

## 44.1 Approach to Brain Masses

### Key Questions

1. **Intra-axial or extra-axial?**
   - Intra-axial: Within brain parenchyma (gliomas, metastases, abscess)
   - Extra-axial: Outside brain, within cranial cavity (meningioma, schwannoma, epidermoid)

2. **Location:** Supratentorial vs. infratentorial; specific lobe

3. **Signal characteristics:** T1, T2, FLAIR, enhancement pattern

4. **Edema:** Vasogenic edema (white matter) surrounding lesion

5. **Multiplicity:** Single vs. multiple lesions

### Intra-axial vs. Extra-axial Signs

| Feature | Intra-axial | Extra-axial |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Brain involvement | Within parenchyma | Displaces brain |
| White matter buckling | May be present | "Bowing" of adjacent cortex |
| CSF cleft | Absent | Often present (trapped CSF) |
| Dural attachment | Absent | May be present (meningioma) |
| Pial vessels | Displaced inward | Between lesion and brain |

## 44.2 Primary Brain Tumors

### Glioma Classification (WHO 2021)

**New WHO classification integrates molecular markers:**

| Tumor | Key Molecular Feature | Grade | Prognosis |
|-------|----------------------|-------|-----------|
| Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant | IDH mutation | II-IV | Better than IDH-wt |
| Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype | IDH wild-type; TERT; EGFR | IV | Poor (GBM) |
| Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant | IDH + 1p/19q codeletion | II-III | Better |

### Glioblastoma (GBM, Grade IV)

**Most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults**

**Age:** 50-70 years

**Location:** Supratentorial; often crosses corpus callosum ("butterfly glioma")

**MRI features:**
- Intra-axial mass
- **Ring-enhancing** thick, irregular rim (necrotic core)
- Central necrosis: Dark T1 center
- Vasogenic edema: T2/FLAIR high signal spreading into white matter "fingers"
- Hemorrhage possible (blooming on SWI)
- Rapid growth and spread
- **Butterfly sign:** Bilateral extension across corpus callosum

**Prognosis:** 15-month median survival with treatment

### Lower-Grade Gliomas (WHO II-III)

**Astrocytoma (IDH-mutant, grade II):**
- Young adults (30-40 years)
- T2/FLAIR high signal; minimal enhancement
- Infiltrative; not well-defined
- Frontal/temporal lobes common

**Oligodendroglioma (IDH-mutant + 1p/19q codeletion):**
- Frontal lobe; cortex-based
- Calcification (50%) — "gyriform" or "popcorn" on CT
- Minimal enhancement (grade II)

### Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL)

**In immunocompetent:** Uncommon; aggressive B-cell lymphoma
**In AIDS:** More common; associated with EBV

**MRI features:**
- Deep gray matter (basal ganglia, corpus callosum, periventricular)
- Hyperdense on CT (high cellularity)
- T1: Isointense; T2: often slightly hypointense (dense nuclei)
- **Intense, homogeneous enhancement** (unlike GBM which has ring enhancement)
- Multiple lesions in AIDS; usually single in immunocompetent

**DWI:** Marked restricted diffusion (dense nuclei)

---

## 44.3 Meningioma

**Most common benign intracranial tumor (36% of primary brain tumors)**

**Origin:** Arachnoid cap cells (meninges)

**Age:** 40-70 years; female predominance (2:1)

### Locations

- Parasagittal/falcine (most common)
- Convexity
- Sphenoid wing
- Olfactory groove
- Cerebellopontine angle
- Posterior fossa

### MRI Features

**Extra-axial:**
- "CSF cleft" between lesion and brain
- Displaced brain parenchyma
- Buckling of adjacent white matter

**Signal:**
- T1: Isointense to gray matter
- T2: Isointense to slightly hyperintense

**Enhancement:**
- **Intense, homogeneous enhancement** (highly vascular)
- **Dural tail sign:** Enhancement extending along dura adjacent to tumor (reactive dura, not invasion per se)

**CT:**
- Hyperdense (dense cellularity)
- Calcification (20-30%)
- Hyperostosis of adjacent bone (bone invasion or reactive)
- Intense enhancement

### WHO Grade

- Grade 1 (80%): Benign; cured by complete resection
- Grade 2 (atypical, 15%): Higher recurrence
- Grade 3 (anaplastic, 5%): Malignant

## 44.4 Metastatic Disease

### Brain Metastases

**Most common intracranial tumor in adults** (more common than primary tumors)

**Primary sources:**
- Lung (most common, ~40%)
- Breast
- Melanoma (highest propensity per primary — most hemorrhagic)
- Renal cell carcinoma
- Colorectal

### MRI Features

- Multiple enhancing lesions in majority
- **Gray-white matter junction:** Most common location (blood-borne emboli lodge at watershed)
- Ring or solid enhancement
- Surrounding vasogenic edema (may be disproportionately large)

**Hemorrhagic metastases:**
- Melanoma (most common cause of hemorrhagic mets)
- Renal cell carcinoma
- Choriocarcinoma

**Special cases:**
- Solitary metastasis vs. primary tumor: Cannot distinguish on MRI alone (biopsy required)
- Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis: Enhancement of meninges + cranial nerves; CSF cytology

### Single vs. Multiple Lesions

**Single enhancing lesion:**
- Metastasis
- GBM (ring-enhancing)
- Abscess (ring-enhancing)
- Tumefactive MS
- Primary CNS lymphoma

**Multiple enhancing lesions:**
- Metastases (most common)
- PCNSL (AIDS)
- Abscesses
- Toxoplasmosis (AIDS)

## 44.5 Ring-Enhancing Lesions

### Differential Diagnosis

**Mnemonic: "MAGIC DR"**
- **M** — Metastasis
- **A** — Abscess
- **G** — Glioblastoma (GBM)
- **I** — Infection (pyogenic)
- **C** — Cryptococcus / other fungal
- **D** — Demyelination (tumefactive MS)
- **R** — Radiation necrosis

### Distinguishing Features

| Feature | GBM | Abscess | Metastasis |
|---------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Enhancement | Thick, irregular ring | Thin, smooth ring | Thin-moderate ring |
| Center | Necrotic; T2 high | Pus; T2 high | Variable |
| DWI | Central low restriction | **Central DWI restriction (pus)** | Variable |
| Edema | Extensive fingers | Moderate | Moderate-extensive |
| Location | White matter | Any | Gray-white junction |
| Number | Usually 1 | Usually 1 | Often multiple |

**DWI is key:** Central restricted diffusion = pus (abscess) vs. necrosis (GBM)

---

## Key Points Summary

1. **GBM** — ring-enhancing; necrotic core; butterfly sign across corpus callosum; poor prognosis

2. **Meningioma** — extra-axial; intense homogeneous enhancement; dural tail; calcification on CT; most commonly benign

3. **Brain metastases** — multiple lesions at gray-white junction; lung is most common source; melanoma most hemorrhagic

4. **Ring-enhancing lesion differential** — "MAGIC DR": Metastasis, Abscess, GBM, Infection, Cryptococcal, Demyelination, Radiation necrosis

5. **Abscess** — thin, smooth ring enhancement; **central DWI restriction** (restricted diffusion in pus) distinguishes from GBM

6. **Primary CNS lymphoma** — intense homogeneous enhancement; periventricular/basal ganglia; exquisitely chemo-sensitive
