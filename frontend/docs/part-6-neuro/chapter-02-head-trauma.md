# Chapter 41: Head Trauma Imaging

## Learning Objectives

- Identify skull fracture types on CT and plain radiography
- Differentiate epidural from subdural hematoma radiographically
- Recognize subarachnoid hemorrhage on non-contrast CT
- Describe cerebral contusions and diffuse axonal injury
- Assess midline shift and herniation on CT

---

## 41.1 Initial Imaging Approach

### Non-Contrast CT Head

**First-line investigation** for all significant head trauma.

**Advantages:**
- Rapid (completed in &lt;5 min)
- Excellent for detecting acute blood (hyperdense)
- No sedation required
- Detects fractures, hemorrhage, edema
- Available 24/7 in most centers

**CT Hounsfield Units (HU) — Key Densities:**
| Structure | HU |
|-----------|-----|
| Air | -1000 |
| Fat | -100 |
| CSF | 0 |
| Soft tissue/brain | 20-60 |
| **Acute blood** | **50-80** |
| **Subacute blood** | **35-50** (isodense) |
| Bone | 400-1000 |

**Acute blood appears bright (white) because hemoglobin is proteinaceous and absorbs more X-rays.**

## 41.2 Skull Fractures

### Linear Skull Fracture

**Most common type**

**Radiographic features:**
- Thin dark line on skull X-ray or CT
- Lacks sclerotic margins (unlike venous lakes/sutures)
- Does not follow suture lines
- May cross vascular grooves (middle meningeal artery) → epidural hematoma risk

**Key concern:** If fracture crosses middle meningeal groove → epidural hematoma

### Depressed Skull Fracture

- Cortical fragment driven below inner table
- Significant if depressed >1 cm or depth greater than skull thickness
- Requires surgical elevation if:
  - Cosmetically significant
  - Underlying dural tear/brain compression
  - Open fracture (contaminated)

**CT (3D reconstruction):** Best for assessing degree of depression and surgical planning

### Basilar Skull Fracture

**Location:** Base of skull (temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, occipital)

**Clinical signs:**
- Raccoon eyes (periorbital ecchymosis — anterior fossa)
- Battle's sign (mastoid ecchymosis — posterior fossa, temporal bone)
- CSF rhinorrhea (anterior fossa fracture → middle cranial fossa)
- CSF otorrhea
- Hemotympanum

**CT findings:**
- Fracture through skull base (temporal bone most common)
- Pneumocephalus (air in subdural/epidural space)
- Hemorrhage in mastoid air cells / paranasal sinuses
- Blood in sphenoid sinus

---

## 41.3 Epidural Hematoma (EDH)

### Pathophysiology

Arterial bleeding (usually middle meningeal artery) into potential space between skull and dura.

**Key:** Dura is stripped from inner table by expanding hematoma

### "Lucid interval" Classic History

- Initial brief LOC → lucid → rapid deterioration
- Due to: arterial bleeding → expanding hematoma → herniation
- Classic but only in minority of cases

### Radiographic Features

**CT (classic):**
- **Biconvex (lenticular) hyperdense** collection adjacent to skull
- Typically **temporal** location (middle meningeal artery)
- Does **NOT cross sutures** (dura attached at sutures)
- May cross midline but not falx
- May show "swirl sign": mixed density = active arterial bleeding (emergency)
- Hyperdense (acute blood: 50-80 HU)
- Mass effect: Midline shift, effacement of ipsilateral ventricle

**Associated:**
- Skull fracture (90% of adults with EDH)
- Note: In children, EDH can occur WITHOUT fracture (skull more elastic)

---

## 41.4 Subdural Hematoma (SDH)

### Pathophysiology

Venous bleeding from bridging veins between cortex and dural sinuses.

**Causes:**
- Trauma (acceleration-deceleration)
- Elderly: minor trauma may suffice (cerebral atrophy → stretched bridging veins)
- Anticoagulant therapy
- Non-accidental injury (infants)

### CT Appearance by Age

| Stage | Time | Appearance |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Hyperacute** | &lt;6 hours | Isodense (may miss) |
| **Acute** | 1-3 days | Hyperdense (50-80 HU) |
| **Subacute** | 4 days-3 weeks | Isodense (isoattenuating to brain — most easily missed!) |
| **Chronic** | >3 weeks | Hypodense (CSF density, 0-30 HU) |

### Radiographic Features

- **Crescent-shaped** collection along inner table
- **Follows inner table of skull** (unlike EDH which is biconvex)
- **Crosses sutures** (blood in subdural space freely crosses sutures)
- Does NOT cross the falx (SDH remains ipsilateral)

**Midline shift calculation:**
- Midline shift: distance that septum pellucidum is displaced from midline
- >5 mm shift → significant; surgical threshold often >1 cm

### Mixed-Density SDH

Active rebleeding into old chronic SDH:
- Shows hyperdense (acute) within hypodense (chronic) collection
- "Hematocrit effect": Dense layer below lighter layer

## 41.5 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

### Causes

- **Traumatic SAH:** Most common cause of subarachnoid blood
- **Spontaneous SAH:** Berry (saccular) aneurysm rupture (most common non-traumatic)
- AVM, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome

### CT Findings

**Acute traumatic SAH:**
- Hyperdense blood within subarachnoid sulci (gyral surface)
- Interpeduncular cistern, sylvian fissure, basalar cisterns
- "Filled sulci" — normally CSF-filled sulci appear white

**Aneurysmal SAH:**
- Classically fills basal cisterns (interpeduncular, prepontine)
- Distribution depends on aneurysm location:
  - ACoA aneurysm: Interhemispheric fissure
  - MCA aneurysm: Sylvian fissure
  - ICA aneurysm: Suprasellar cistern

**CT Sensitivity for SAH:**
- Within 12 hours: ~98-100%
- 24 hours: ~95%
- 7 days: ~50-70%
- If CT negative but SAH suspected: LP for xanthochromia

### Complications of SAH

- Vasospasm (days 4-14): TCD, CTA, or angiography
- Hydrocephalus (obstructive or communicating)
- Rebleeding (highest risk in first 24 hours before treatment)

## 41.6 Cerebral Contusions

### Definition

Bruising of the brain surface (coup and contrecoup injuries).

### Mechanism

- **Coup:** Injury at site of impact
- **Contrecoup:** Injury opposite to impact (brain bounces against skull)

**Susceptible locations:** Frontal and temporal poles (irregular skull base)

### CT Findings

**Acute:**
- Heterogeneous foci of hyperdensity (hemorrhage) within hypodense area (edema)
- "Salt and pepper" appearance
- At cortical surface
- May enlarge over 24-48 hours ("contusion blooming")

**MRI (more sensitive):**
- Detects non-hemorrhagic contusions
- T2/FLAIR: High signal
- GRE/SWI: Blood products as dark "blooming" foci

---

## 41.7 Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)

### Mechanism

High-speed angular deceleration → shear injury to axons at gray-white matter junction

### CT Findings

- Often **normal CT** despite severe clinical injury
- When visible: Small hemorrhagic foci at:
  - Gray-white matter junction
  - Corpus callosum
  - Dorsolateral brainstem (rostral midbrain)
  - Internal capsule

### MRI for DAI

- CT misses most non-hemorrhagic DAI
- **SWI (Susceptibility Weighted Imaging):** Most sensitive; numerous dark "blooming" foci represent microhemorrhages
- **DWI:** Restricted diffusion in acutely injured axons
- **FLAIR:** T2 signal abnormality at gray-white junction

---

## 41.8 Midline Shift and Herniation

### Assessing Midline Shift

- Measured at the level of the foramen of Monro
- Distance from septum pellucidum to midline (falx)
- >5 mm is significant; >10 mm often requires surgical intervention

### Transtentorial (Uncal) Herniation

**Most dangerous type**

**CT signs:**
- Effacement of ipsilateral suprasellar cistern
- Displacement of uncus and temporal lobe medially and downward
- Loss of normal basal cisterns
- CN III compression (ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil)
- Contralateral peduncle compression → ipsilateral hemiplegia

### Subfalcine Herniation

- Cingulate gyrus herniates under falx cerebri
- CT: Midline shift; compression of ipsilateral lateral ventricle
- Anterior cerebral artery may be compressed → contralateral leg weakness

### Tonsillar Herniation

- Cerebellar tonsils herniate through foramen magnum
- Compresses brainstem
- CT: Low-lying cerebellar tonsils; effacement of cisterna magna

## Key Points Summary

1. **Acute blood** appears bright (hyperdense, 50-80 HU) on non-contrast CT; becomes isodense (subacute), then hypodense (chronic) for SDH

2. **EDH** — biconvex shape; does not cross sutures; usually temporal (middle meningeal artery); 90% have skull fracture

3. **SDH** — crescent shape; crosses sutures but NOT falx; subacute SDH can be isodense (most easily missed)

4. **CT sensitivity for SAH** decreases rapidly after onset; LP for xanthochromia if CT negative at >6-12 hours

5. **DAI** — often normal CT despite severe injury; SWI MRI most sensitive for microhemorrhages

6. **Midline shift >5 mm** is significant; loss of basal cisterns indicates impending herniation
