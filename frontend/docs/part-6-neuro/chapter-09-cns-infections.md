# Chapter 48: Infections and Inflammatory CNS Disease

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize meningitis imaging findings on MRI
- Identify brain abscess and differentiate from tumor
- Describe encephalitis patterns on MRI
- Recognize multiple sclerosis white matter lesions
- Describe CNS tuberculosis and fungal infection imaging

---

## 48.1 Meningitis

### Bacterial Meningitis

**Clinical:** Fever, neck stiffness, headache, photophobia; LP is diagnostic

**CT/MRI indications:**
- Before LP if: focal neurology, papilledema, altered consciousness, immunocompromised
- To exclude: Mass lesion, obstructive hydrocephalus (LP contraindicated if present)

**Normal CT:** Common in uncomplicated bacterial meningitis (CT does NOT exclude meningitis)

**MRI findings (contrast enhanced):**
- Leptomeningeal enhancement: Smooth linear enhancement of meninges and cisterns
- "Leptomeningeal enhancement" along sulci: Wiggly sulcal enhancement
- FLAIR: Hyperintense sulci (high protein CSF)
- May progress to complications

### Complications of Meningitis

**Hydrocephalus:**
- Communicating: Meningeal fibrosis → impaired CSF reabsorption
- Obstructive: Less common; ependymitis

**Ventriculitis (ependymitis):**
- Enhancement of ependyma
- High T2 signal in periventricular white matter

**Subdural empyema:**
- Extra-axial collection with rim enhancement
- Restricted diffusion (pus)
- Emergency drainage required

**Cerebral infarction:**
- Vasospasm / arteritis
- Territorial or watershed infarction

**Brain abscess** (see below)

---

## 48.2 Brain Abscess

### Pathogenesis

- Direct extension: Sinusitis (frontal/ethmoid → frontal lobe), mastoiditis (→ temporal/cerebellar)
- Hematogenous: From pulmonary, dental, cardiac (endocarditis) infection
- Post-trauma or neurosurgery
- Immunocompromised: Opportunistic organisms (Toxoplasma, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus)

### CT Features

**Stages of abscess:**
1. Cerebritis (early): Ill-defined low-density area; poorly defined enhancement
2. Capsule formation: Ring-enhancing lesion with central low density (pus)

**Classic CT appearance:**
- Ring-enhancing lesion with hypodense center
- Thin, smooth wall (unlike GBM which has thick, irregular ring)
- Surrounding vasogenic edema
- Mass effect

### MRI Features

**T1:** Low signal center; isointense ring; surrounding hypointense edema
**T2:** High signal center (pus); low signal ring (capsule — fibrous/hemosiderin); surrounding high signal edema

**KEY DISTINGUISHING FEATURE — DWI:**
- **Abscess: Central restricted diffusion (HIGH DWI, LOW ADC)**
- GBM: Central low DWI (necrotic)
- Metastasis: Variable
- **DWI restriction in center = pus = abscess**

**Post-contrast T1:**
- Thin, smooth, complete ring enhancement
- Medial wall thinner than lateral (approaches to CSF — less vascular)

## 48.3 Encephalitis

### Viral Encephalitis

**Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) — most common fatal encephalitis**

**Caused by:** HSV-1 (adults); HSV-2 (neonates)

**Hallmark location:** Temporal lobes + insular cortex + cingulate gyrus (limbic structures)
- Bilateral but often asymmetric
- Frontal and parietal lobes may be affected in severe cases

**MRI features:**
- T2/FLAIR: High signal in temporal lobes, insula
- DWI: Restricted diffusion (early ischemic-like changes)
- Hemorrhagic changes: GRE blooming
- Post-contrast: Gyriform or patchy enhancement

**Clinical urgency:** If HSE suspected — start IV acyclovir IMMEDIATELY (do not wait for imaging or LP confirmation)

### CMV Encephalitis

- Immunocompromised (AIDS, transplant)
- Periventricular enhancement (ependymitis)
- Periventricular T2 signal

### Japanese Encephalitis

- Thalamic involvement (bilateral) — characteristic
- Also basal ganglia involvement

---

## 48.4 Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

### Pathology

Autoimmune demyelinating disease:
- Focal demyelination in white matter and gray matter
- Perivenular inflammation → plaque formation
- Relapsing-remitting (most common), primary progressive, secondary progressive

### MRI — Diagnostic Criteria for MS (McDonald Criteria)

Must demonstrate **dissemination in space (DIS)** and **dissemination in time (DIT)**:

**DIS (Multiple Lesions):**
Lesions in ≥2 of 4 anatomical locations:
- Periventricular
- Cortical/juxtacortical
- Infratentorial (posterior fossa)
- Spinal cord

**DIT:**
- Simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, OR
- New T2/enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI

### MS Lesion Characteristics

**MRI features:**
- T2/FLAIR: Hyperintense white matter lesions
- T1: "Black holes" — chronically demyelinated areas (low T1); acute lesion T1 low
- Post-contrast T1: Enhancing lesion = active demyelination (BBB disruption)
- DWI: Variable; restricted diffusion in acute inflammatory lesion

**Periventricular lesions:**
- Ovoid, perpendicular to ventricles — "Dawson's fingers" (along medullary veins)
- Appears like fingers pointing toward ventricles on sagittal FLAIR

**Corpus callosum lesions:**
- "Calloso-septal interface" lesions
- FLAIR sagittal: Best for visualization

### Spinal Cord in MS

- Short lesions (&lt;3 vertebral body heights)
- Peripheral (dorsolateral) location
- Cervical cord most common
- Enhancement in active lesion

### Tumefactive MS

- Large (>2 cm) demyelinating lesion mimicking tumor
- May have ring enhancement
- DWI: Peripheral restricted diffusion (perilesional DWI restriction — opposite of abscess)
- Requires biopsy or careful correlation with other MS features

## 48.5 CNS Tuberculosis and Fungal Infections

### CNS Tuberculosis

**Forms:**
1. **TB Meningitis (most common CNS TB)**
2. **Tuberculoma** (focal granuloma)
3. **Miliary TB**
4. **TB Abscess**
5. **Spinal TB (Pott's disease)**

**TB Meningitis:**
- Thick, exudative basal meningitis (around basal cisterns)
- CT: Enhancing basal cisterns; hydrocephalus
- MRI: Thick basal leptomeningeal enhancement; cranial nerve enhancement (CN III, VI, VII)
- **Complications:** Vasculitis → infarction (basal ganglia); hydrocephalus; cranial nerve palsies

**Tuberculoma:**
- Solitary or multiple granulomas
- **Concentric ring pattern on MRI** with central area of varying signal
- Target sign: Central dot of calcification within granuloma
- **Ring-enhancing** lesion (like abscess) — differentiated by DWI (tuberculoma central NOT restricted like pyogenic abscess)

### Cryptococcal Meningitis

**Organism:** Cryptococcus neoformans (yeast)
**Patients:** Immunocompromised (especially AIDS, CD4 &lt;100)

**MRI features:**
- "Soap bubble" cysts in basal ganglia — gelatinous pseudocysts filled with cryptococcal organisms
- Minimal surrounding edema (immunodeficient host has poor inflammatory response)
- Meningeal enhancement may be minimal or absent

**Diagnosis:** India ink preparation; cryptococcal antigen in CSF

### Toxoplasmosis

**Organism:** Toxoplasma gondii
**Patients:** AIDS (CD4 &lt;100)

**MRI features:**
- Multiple ring-enhancing lesions
- **Basal ganglia and corticomedullary junction** — most common locations
- Eccentric target sign: Eccentric nodule within enhancing ring
- Surrounding edema

**Vs. CNS lymphoma in AIDS:**
| Feature | Toxoplasmosis | PCNSL |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Number | Multiple | Often single |
| DWI | Low restriction | High restriction |
| Location | Basal ganglia, junction | Periventricular, corpus callosum |
| Response to empirical treatment | Yes (treat empirically) | No |
| PET | Low FDG uptake | High FDG uptake |

## Key Points Summary

1. **Brain abscess** — central DWI restriction (pus); thin, smooth ring enhancement; medial wall thinner

2. **HSV encephalitis** — temporal lobes + insular cortex + cingulate gyrus; T2 high signal; start acyclovir immediately

3. **MS lesions** — periventricular "Dawson's fingers"; dissemination in space and time required for diagnosis

4. **TB meningitis** — thick basal exudate; enhancing basal cisterns; hydrocephalus; cranial nerve involvement; infarction

5. **Cryptococcal CNS** — "soap bubble" gelatinous pseudocysts in basal ganglia; minimal inflammatory response in AIDS

6. **Toxoplasmosis** — multiple ring-enhancing lesions; basal ganglia; treat empirically; response confirms diagnosis
