## 42.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke — Early CT Signs

### Non-Contrast CT Brain in Acute Stroke

**Purpose:** Primarily to EXCLUDE hemorrhage before thrombolysis

**Time window:** Most signs appear within 3-6 hours; very early CT may be normal

### Early CT Signs of Ischemia

**Dense artery sign:**
- Hyperdense (white) artery = thrombus within vessel
- **Hyperdense MCA sign:** Most classic — dense MCA trunk on non-contrast CT
- **Dot sign:** Small hyperdense branch within Sylvian fissure

**Loss of grey-white differentiation:**
- Cytotoxic edema causes brain swelling and loss of density
- Basal ganglia: Lentiform nucleus density decreases (loses definition)
- **Insular ribbon sign:** Loss of definition of insular cortex (cortex becomes isodense to white matter)

**Sulcal effacement:**
- Swollen cortex obliterates normally CSF-filled sulci
- Subtle but early sign

**ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score):**
- Scores ischemic changes in MCA territory
- 10 regions: 10 = normal; subtract 1 point for each ischemic region
- ASPECTS ≤6: Poor prognosis; &lt;5: consider against thrombolysis

### Limitations of Non-Contrast CT

- Low sensitivity for acute ischemia (&lt;50% in first 3 hours)
- Cannot detect posterior fossa ischemia (bone artifact)
- Cannot determine penumbra (salvageable tissue) vs. core

## 42.2 CT Angiography (CTA) for Vessel Occlusion

### Indication

- All patients with acute stroke or TIA in whom intervention is being considered
- Detect large vessel occlusion (LVO)

### Technique

- IV contrast, arterial phase
- Includes: Circle of Willis (brain), carotid and vertebral arteries (neck), sometimes aortic arch

### Findings

**Vessel occlusion:**
- Abrupt termination of contrast column
- Filling defect within the vessel ("cold spot")
- Loss of normal vascular opacification

**Collateral assessment:**
- Pial collaterals fill distally from intact vessels
- Good collaterals: Better prognosis; more salvageable tissue
- CTA multiplanar reconstruction: MCA and branches

**Extracranial stenosis:**
- Carotid stenosis: NASCET method for degree
- Vertebral artery stenosis or dissection

### LVO Identification

Large vessel occlusions appropriate for mechanical thrombectomy:
- ICA terminus, MCA (M1 ± M2), basilar artery, PCA
- Time window for thrombectomy: up to 24 hours with imaging selection

## 42.3 CT Perfusion Imaging

### Principle

CT perfusion (CTP) measures cerebral hemodynamics:
- Maps cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), Tmax
- Dynamic contrast injection + rapid serial CT
- Software generates color-coded parametric maps

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Definition | In Ischemia |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **CBF** | Volume of blood per unit time per gram of brain | Decreased in ischemia |
| **CBV** | Total blood volume per gram of brain | Decreased in core; may be preserved in penumbra |
| **MTT** | Average transit time through the microcirculation | Prolonged in ischemia |
| **Tmax** | Time to maximum of residue function | Prolonged in ischemia |

### Ischemic Core vs. Penumbra

**Core (irreversibly infarcted):**
- Severely reduced CBF and CBV
- No salvageable tissue
- CTP: Very low CBF + low CBV

**Penumbra (salvageable tissue):**
- Reduced CBF but preserved CBV (autoregulation maintaining volume)
- At risk without treatment but potentially salvageable
- CTP: Low CBF + relatively normal CBV

**Mismatch:** Penumbra > Core = good candidate for intervention

**Clinical decision support:**
- RAPID software: automated CTP analysis
- Helps select patients for late-window thrombectomy (6-24 hours)

## 42.4 MRI in Acute Stroke

### Advantages of MRI Over CT

- Higher sensitivity for ischemia (especially early and posterior fossa)
- DWI detects ischemia within minutes
- Better characterization of lesion age
- No radiation

### Disadvantages

- Time: Longer than CT
- Availability: Not always available 24/7
- Patient factors: Agitation, claustrophobia

### DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging)

**Most important sequence for acute stroke**

**Mechanism:**
- Water molecules in ischemic brain are restricted in diffusion (cytotoxic edema)
- Restricted diffusion = high DWI signal + low ADC signal

**Findings in acute ischemia:**
- **High DWI signal** (bright)
- **Low ADC value** (dark on ADC map)
- This pattern = **definitive acute ischemia**

**Timeline:**
- DWI positive within minutes of ischemia onset
- Remains bright for ~7-10 days
- ADC normalizes after 10-14 days ("pseudonormalization")

### FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery)

- Suppresses CSF signal; shows brain parenchyma
- DWI-FLAIR mismatch:
  - DWI positive but FLAIR negative = likely &lt;4.5 hours since onset (early infarct)
  - DWI positive + FLAIR positive = likely >4.5-6 hours
  - Used to guide thrombolysis when time of onset unknown ("wake-up stroke")

### MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography)

- TOF MRA: Visualizes intracranial vessels without contrast
- Detects large vessel occlusion
- Slower than CTA but no radiation or contrast

### GRE/SWI

- Detects microhemorrhage ("blooming")
- Hemorrhagic transformation of infarct
- Relevant before thrombolysis decision

---

## 42.5 Hemorrhagic Stroke

### Types of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)

**Hypertensive hemorrhage (most common spontaneous ICH):**
- Deep brain locations: basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, cerebellum
- Due to hypertensive arteriolosclerosis
- "Charcot-Bouchard" microaneurysms

**Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):**
- Lobar hemorrhages (subcortical)
- Elderly patients
- Multiple microbleeds on SWI

**Coagulopathy-related:**
- Anticoagulants (warfarin, NOAC)
- Multiple or unusual locations

### CT Findings

- **Acute ICH:** Hyperdense (bright) intraparenchymal mass
- Edema develops around clot (hypodense ring)
- Mass effect: midline shift, ventricular compression
- May rupture into ventricles (intraventricular hemorrhage — IVH)

### Differentiating Ischemic from Hemorrhagic Stroke

| Feature | Ischemic Stroke | Hemorrhagic Stroke |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| CT appearance | Low density (edema) | Hyperdense (bright) |
| Timing of symptoms | Variable | Usually sudden |
| Hypertension | Risk factor | Strong predictor |
| Vascular territory | Yes | Not always |
| Treatment | Thrombolysis ± thrombectomy | Reverse anticoagulation; surgical in some |

## Key Points Summary

1. **Dense MCA sign** on non-contrast CT = thrombus; early sign of ischemic stroke

2. **ASPECTS score** quantifies early ischemic changes in MCA territory; ≤6 indicates extensive ischemia

3. **CTA** detects large vessel occlusion — key for thrombectomy decision; vessel absent or abrupt cutoff

4. **CT perfusion** maps core vs. penumbra; mismatch = salvageable tissue available for intervention

5. **DWI MRI** — high signal + low ADC = definitive acute ischemia; positive within minutes

6. **DWI-FLAIR mismatch** — DWI+ FLAIR- = likely within 4.5 hours; guides thrombolysis in unknown onset
