# Chapter 47: Spinal Cord Pathology

## Learning Objectives

- Describe MRI evaluation of spinal cord compression
- Recognize myelitis and inflammatory cord lesions
- Identify syringomyelia on MRI
- Describe vascular malformations of the spinal cord
- Explain indications for urgent spinal MRI

---

## 47.1 Spinal Cord Compression

### Causes

**Extradural (outside dura — most common):**
- Disc herniation
- Metastatic spine disease (vertebral mets → epidural extension)
- Epidural abscess
- Hematoma
- Bone fragments (trauma)

**Intradural extramedullary (inside dura, outside cord):**
- Meningioma
- Schwannoma / Neurofibroma
- Ependymoma (of cauda equina)
- Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis

**Intramedullary (within cord itself):**
- Ependymoma (most common intramedullary cord tumor — adults)
- Astrocytoma (children)
- Metastasis (rare)
- Cavernoma

### MRI for Cord Compression

**Protocol:**
- Sagittal T1, T2: Anatomy, cord signal, disc levels
- Axial T1, T2: Degree of compression, laterality
- Post-contrast T1: Epidural abscess, tumor enhancement

**Cord findings indicating chronic compression:**
- T2 bright signal (myelopathy): Chronic cord damage
- Cord atrophy

**Emergency cord compression:**
- Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC): Oncological emergency
- MRI whole spine if metastatic disease suspected (may be multifocal)

## 47.2 Myelitis and Inflammatory Conditions

### Transverse Myelitis

**Definition:** Acute/subacute inflammatory demyelinating cord lesion crossing the cord width.

**Causes:**
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD — anti-AQP4 antibodies)
- Idiopathic
- Post-viral (HSV, EBV)
- Autoimmune

**MRI features:**
- T2 bright intramedullary signal
- Cord swelling (acute)
- Spans >1 vertebral level (usually)
- Enhancement in active lesion

**Short vs. long cord lesions:**
- Short (&lt;3 vertebral levels): Typical for MS
- Long (>3 vertebral levels — LETM = Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis): Typical for NMOSD; also infectious, anti-NMDAR

### Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Spinal Cord

**Typical MS cord lesions:**
- Cervical cord most common
- Short (&lt;3 vertebral levels)
- Peripheral (dorsal, lateral — NOT central)
- Ovoid on sagittal view
- T2 bright; may enhance with contrast (active lesion)

**NMOSD (Neuromyelitis Optica):**
- Longitudinally extensive cord lesions (>3 vertebral levels)
- Central cord involvement
- Often with optic neuritis
- Anti-AQP4 antibody positive

## 47.3 Syrinx (Syringomyelia)

### Definition

A fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord.

**Communicating syrinx:** Connected to central canal of cord; extension of hydromyelia

**Non-communicating syrinx:** Not connected to central canal; from trauma, tumor, arachnoiditis, Chiari malformation

### Causes

- **Chiari I malformation** (most common cause): Cerebellar tonsils herniate through foramen magnum → impair CSF flow → syrinx
- Post-traumatic
- Intramedullary tumor
- Arachnoiditis
- Tethered cord

### MRI Features

- Well-defined fluid-filled cavity within cord
- T1: Low (CSF density)
- T2: Bright (CSF signal)
- No enhancement (unless infected or tumoral)
- Cord may be widened
- Associated Chiari malformation visible on brain MRI

### Chiari Malformation

**Chiari I:**
- Cerebellar tonsils >5 mm below foramen magnum
- Most common in adults; may be incidental
- Associated syrinx in 25%
- Symptoms: Occipital headache aggravated by Valsalva, syrinx symptoms

**Chiari II:**
- Associated with myelomeningocele
- Cerebellar vermis, pons, medulla all herniate
- Tectal beaking; "banana" sign of cerebellum on antenatal US
- Lemon sign (skull shape) on antenatal US

## 47.4 Vascular Malformations of the Spine

### Spinal Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)

**Types:**
| Type | Description | Presentation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Intradural AVM | Nidus within cord | Hemorrhage, myelopathy |
| Dural AVF (most common) | Fistula at dural nerve root sleeve | Progressive myelopathy |
| Perimedullary AVF | On surface of cord | Progressive or hemorrhage |

**Spinal Dural AVF (most common spinal vascular malformation):**
- Middle-aged to elderly men
- Progressive ascending myelopathy (venous hypertension)
- MRI: T2 high signal cord; "flow voids" on dorsal cord surface (engorged veins)
- MRA/Angiography for diagnosis

### Cavernoma (Cavernous Malformation)

- Spinal cord cavernoma: Rare
- MRI: "Popcorn" appearance; hemosiderin rim
- Presents with acute hemorrhage → myelopathy
- Surgical excision if accessible

---

## 47.5 Intramedullary Tumors

### Ependymoma

**Most common intramedullary tumor in adults**

**Location:** Cervical cord or conus medullaris (myxopapillary ependymoma)

**MRI features:**
- Well-defined, centrally placed within cord
- T2 bright; may have associated syrinx (rostral and caudal)
- "Polar cysts" at tumor margins
- **"Cap sign":** Hemosiderin caps at superior and inferior tumor poles (from previous hemorrhage) — dark on T2/GRE
- Enhancement: Solid, heterogeneous

### Astrocytoma

**Most common intramedullary tumor in children**

**MRI features:**
- Poorly defined margins (infiltrative)
- Often extends over multiple levels
- Enhancement: Variable, patchy
- No "cap sign"
- Associated syrinx

### Differentiating Ependymoma from Astrocytoma

| Feature | Ependymoma | Astrocytoma |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Margins | Well-defined | Poorly defined |
| Location | Central | Eccentric |
| Enhancement | Solid, well-defined | Irregular, patchy |
| Hemosiderin caps | Present (cap sign) | Absent |
| Age | Adults | Children |

## 47.6 When to Order Urgent Spinal MRI

### Urgent Indications (&lt;24 hours)

- **Acute myelopathy:** Sudden onset of bilateral weakness, sensory level, bladder/bowel dysfunction
- **Suspected spinal cord compression (metastatic):** Known cancer + new neurological signs
- **Cauda equina syndrome:** Bilateral leg weakness + saddle anesthesia + urinary/bowel dysfunction
- **Epidural abscess:** Fever + spine pain + neurological deficit

### Cauda Equina Syndrome

**Clinical features:**
- Bilateral leg weakness
- Saddle anesthesia (perineum, inner thighs)
- Urinary retention (more specific than incontinence)
- Fecal incontinence or retention

**Imaging:**
- Emergency lumbar MRI
- Cause: Central disc herniation (L4-L5 or L5-S1 most common), tumor, hematoma, abscess

## Key Points Summary

1. **Cord compression levels:** Extradural (metastases, disc) → Intradural extramedullary (meningioma, schwannoma) → Intramedullary (ependymoma, astrocytoma)

2. **Short cord lesions (&lt;3 levels)** = MS; **Long cord lesions (LETM, >3 levels)** = NMOSD or infection

3. **Syrinx** — most often associated with Chiari I malformation; CSF-filled cord cavity on T2 MRI

4. **Ependymoma** — central cord, "cap sign" (hemosiderin poles), well-defined, adults

5. **Spinal dural AVF** — progressive myelopathy; flow voids on dorsal cord; diagnose with spinal MRA/angiography

6. **Cauda equina syndrome** = surgical emergency; bilateral leg weakness + saddle anesthesia + urinary retention
