# Abdominal Radiograph Interpretation

The abdominal radiograph (AXR) remains a cornerstone of emergency and general radiology. A systematic approach ensures no finding is missed and allows accurate diagnosis of common abdominal pathologies.

## Systematic Approach to the AXR

### Technical Assessment
- **Patient position**: Supine is standard; erect views help detect free air and air-fluid levels
- **Exposure**: Vertebral bodies should be faintly visible through the liver
- **Coverage**: Should include diaphragm to symphysis pubis
- **Rotation**: Spinous processes equidistant from pedicles

### ABCDE Approach
- **A** – Air (bowel gas pattern, free air)
- **B** – Bones (vertebrae, ribs, pelvis)
- **C** – Calcifications
- **D** – Density (solid organs)
- **E** – Extras (tubes, lines, foreign bodies)

## Bowel Gas Pattern

### Normal Gas Distribution
- **Stomach**: Left upper quadrant, gas-filled fundus
- **Small bowel**: Central, valvulae conniventes cross full width, &lt;3 cm diameter
- **Large bowel**: Peripheral, haustral folds do not cross full width, &lt;6 cm (cecum &lt;9 cm)

### Abnormal Gas Patterns
- **Sentinel loop**: Isolated dilated loop near inflamed organ (e.g., pancreas in pancreatitis)
- **Gasless abdomen**: Fluid-filled bowel, suggests obstruction or ascites
- **Stepladder pattern**: Multiple air-fluid levels in small bowel obstruction
- **Coffee bean sign**: Sigmoid volvulus — omega loop of sigmoid

## Free Air Detection

### Erect View (Most Sensitive)
- **Subdiaphragmatic free air**: Crescent of lucency beneath diaphragm
- **Right side**: More easily detected (liver provides contrast)
- **Left side**: May be confused with gastric bubble

### Supine View Signs
- **Rigler's sign**: Both sides of bowel wall visible (normally only inner wall seen)
- **Football sign**: Large amount of free air outlines entire peritoneal cavity
- **Falciform ligament sign**: Free air outlines the falciform ligament
- **Triangle sign**: Free air trapped between bowel loops

## Solid Organ Assessment

### Liver
- **Normal size**: Spans right hemidiaphragm to approximately right iliac fossa
- **Hepatomegaly**: Extension beyond right iliac fossa, displacing bowel
- **Density**: Homogeneous soft tissue density
- **Calcifications**: May indicate old granulomas, hemangiomas, or gallstones

### Spleen
- **Normal size**: Should not extend beyond midline
- **Splenomegaly**: Medial displacement of stomach, downward displacement of left kidney
- **Tip**: Should not be palpable if normal on AXR

### Kidneys
- **Psoas shadow**: Both kidneys should be visible obliterating psoas margin
- **Size**: Approximately 3.5 vertebral bodies in height
- **Renal calculi**: Up to 90% of renal stones are radio-opaque

## Calcifications

### Vascular Calcifications
- **Aortic calcification**: Curvilinear calcification in midline/left of midline
- **Aortic aneurysm**: Calcified walls displaced laterally (>3 cm diameter)
- **Iliac artery calcification**: Common in elderly patients

### Urinary Tract Calcifications
- **Renal calculi**: Variable density, located along expected course of ureter
- **Bladder calculi**: Pelvic calcification overlying bladder
- **Ureteric calculi**: May cause renal colic; follow course of ureter

### Biliary Calcifications
- **Gallstones**: 10-15% are radio-opaque, right upper quadrant
- **Porcelain gallbladder**: Curvilinear calcification of gallbladder wall
- **Bile duct stones**: Rare to see on plain film

### Other Calcifications
- **Pancreatic calcification**: Multiple small calculi in epigastric region (chronic pancreatitis)
- **Appendicolith**: Small calcified density right iliac fossa (may indicate appendicitis)
- **Phleboliths**: Round calcifications in pelvis with central lucency (normal variant)
- **Mesenteric lymph nodes**: Scattered calcifications (old granulomatous disease)

## Psoas Sign

### Assessment
- **Normal psoas**: Soft tissue density triangle visible lateral to lumbar spine
- **Absent psoas sign**: Suggests retroperitoneal pathology (hemorrhage, abscess, tumor)
- **Bilateral absence**: Consider retroperitoneal fibrosis or bilateral disease

## Peritoneal Fat Planes

### Properitoneal Fat Stripe
- **Location**: Lateral abdominal wall, between peritoneum and transversalis fascia
- **Displacement/loss**: Suggests peritoneal fluid or mass

### Flank Stripe
- **Normal**: Visible as lucent line lateral to ascending/descending colon
- **Loss**: Suggests free fluid in paracolic gutters

## Bowel Wall Thickening

### Assessment on AXR
- **Normal bowel wall**: Not usually visible on plain film
- **Thumbprinting**: Nodular indentations of bowel wall (ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease)
- **Lead pipe colon**: Featureless, rigid colon without haustra (ulcerative colitis)

## Gas in Abnormal Locations

### Portal Venous Gas
- **Appearance**: Branching lucencies peripherally in liver (vs. biliary gas centrally)
- **Significance**: Serious finding — bowel ischemia, necrotizing enterocolitis
- **Biliary gas**: More central, "tree-in-bud" towards hepatic hilum (post ERCP, biliary-enteric fistula)

### Pneumatosis Intestinalis
- **Appearance**: Gas within bowel wall (linear or bubbly pattern)
- **Causes**: Ischemia (serious), COPD, steroids, IBD (benign forms)

## Pelvic Structures

### Uterus and Ovaries
- **Uterus**: Midline pelvic soft tissue density
- **Calcifications**: Uterine fibroids, ovarian dermoid (teeth/calcification)
- **IUD**: Should be visible as metallic density

### Bladder
- **Normal**: Smooth-walled oval density in pelvis
- **Displacement**: By pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy

## Common Pathologies Summary

| Condition | Key AXR Finding |
|-----------|----------------|
| Small bowel obstruction | Central dilated loops, valvulae conniventes, air-fluid levels |
| Large bowel obstruction | Peripheral dilation, haustral folds, collapsed small bowel |
| Sigmoid volvulus | Coffee bean sign, inverted U |
| Perforated viscus | Free air under diaphragm |
| Pancreatitis | Sentinel loop, colon cut-off sign |
| Renal colic | Renal tract calcification |
| Acute appendicitis | Appendicolith, loss of psoas shadow |

A systematic, consistent approach to abdominal radiograph interpretation ensures that significant pathology is not missed and appropriate further investigation is ordered promptly.
