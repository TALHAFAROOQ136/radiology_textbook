## Introduction to Abdominal Anatomy

The abdomen contains numerous vital organs from multiple systems including digestive, urinary, reproductive, and endocrine systems. Abdominal radiology requires understanding of these complex structures and their normal appearances on various imaging modalities. The abdomen presents unique challenges compared to other regions due to the presence of gas, fluid, and soft tissue structures that can overlap and obscure pathology.

### Overview of Abdominal Regions

The abdomen is divided into nine regions:
- Right hypochondriac
- Epigastrium
- Left hypochondriac
- Right lumbar
- Umbilical
- Left lumbar
- Right iliac (inguinal)
- Hypogastrium (pubic)
- Left iliac (inguinal)

## Gastrointestinal System

### Stomach

The stomach is located in the left upper quadrant and has several distinct parts:

- **Cardia**: Surrounds the gastroesophageal junction
- **Fundus**: Uppermost portion, often gas-filled on radiographs
- **Body**: Main portion of the stomach
- **Antrum**: Distal portion leading to pylorus
- **Pylorus**: Connects stomach to duodenum

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Distensible gas and fluid-filled organ
- Wall thickness `<5mm`
- Normal air-fluid levels

### Small Bowel

The small bowel is divided into three parts:

- **Duodenum**: Begins at pylorus, ends at ligament of Treitz
- **Jejunum**: Proximal two-fifths of small bowel
- **Ileum**: Distal three-fifths of small bowel

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Mucosal folds (valvulae conniventes) more prominent in jejunum
- Jejunum has wider caliber and more mucosal folds than ileum
- Small bowel should not exceed 3cm in diameter

### Large Bowel (Colon)

The colon is divided into several segments:

- **Cecum**: Beginning of colon, contains appendiceal orifice
- **Ascending colon**: Ascends on right side
- **Hepatic flexure**: Right colonic turn near liver
- **Transverse colon**: Crosses upper abdomen
- **Splenic flexure**: Left colonic turn near spleen
- **Descending colon**: Descends on left side
- **Sigmoid colon**: S-shaped curve in pelvis
- **Rectum**: Terminal portion of large bowel

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Appendices epiploicae may be visible as small fat-filled projections
- Haustra (pouch-like segments) are characteristic
- Normal caliber `<6cm`

### Appendix

- Tubular extension of cecum
- Variable length and position
- Not always visible on plain radiographs

## Hepatobiliary System

### Liver

The largest internal organ with several important features:

- **Right lobe**: Larger than left lobe
- **Left lobe**: Smaller, extends left of midline
- **Falciform ligament**: Attaches liver to anterior abdominal wall
- **Porta hepatis**: Site where portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile ducts enter
- **Couinaud classification**: Divides liver into eight functionally independent segments

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Homogeneous soft tissue density
- Sharp margins
- Normal size: Right lobe tip should not extend below right kidney by more than 2cm

### Gallbladder

- Pear-shaped organ located beneath liver
- Stores and concentrates bile
- Connected to biliary system via cystic duct

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Usually not visible on plain radiographs (gasless)
- May contain gallstones (radiopaque in 10-15% of cases)

### Biliary System

- **Common hepatic duct**: Formed by confluence of right and left hepatic ducts
- **Common bile duct**: Formed by union of common hepatic and cystic ducts
- **Pancreatic duct**: Joins common bile duct at ampulla of Vater

## Pancreas

The pancreas has several parts:

- **Head**: Lies in C-loop of duodenum
- **Neck**: Narrows between head and body
- **Body**: Crosses midline
- **Tail**: Extends toward splenic hilum

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Retroperitoneal organ
- Often indistinct on plain films
- May be identified by its relationship to duodenum and splenic vein

## Urinary System

### Kidneys

The kidneys are retroperitoneal organs with specific characteristics:

- **Right kidney**: Slightly lower than left due to liver
- **Left kidney**: Positioned slightly higher
- **Hilum**: Point where renal artery, vein, and ureter enter/exit
- **Collecting system**: Central portion containing urine

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Bean-shaped structures
- Size: Approximately 10-12cm in length
- Normal psoas muscle shadow should be visible adjacent to each kidney

### Ureters

- Extend from kidneys to bladder
- Divide into upper, middle, and lower thirds
- Usually not visible on plain films unless dilated or calcified

### Bladder

- Distensible organ in pelvis
- Stores urine prior to voiding
- Normal capacity ~400-600ml

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Oval or rounded gasless structure in pelvis when full
- Wall thickness `<5mm`

## Spleen

- Largest lymphoid organ
- Located in left upper quadrant
- Functions in blood filtration and immune response

**Normal Radiological Appearance:**
- Oblong soft tissue density
- Length should not exceed 12cm
- Should not cross midline

## Retroperitoneal Structures

### Adrenal Glands

- Sit atop each kidney
- Difficult to visualize on plain films
- Associated with the upper poles of kidneys

### Aorta and Inferior Vena Cava

- **Abdominal aorta**: Descends from diaphragm, bifurcates at L4
- **Inferior vena cava**: Ascends on right side of aorta

## Abdominal Wall

### Muscles

- **Rectus abdominis**: Paired muscles in anterior abdomen
- **External and internal obliques**: Laterally positioned muscles
- **Transversus abdominis**: Deepest muscle layer

### Peritoneum

- Serous membrane lining abdominal cavity
- Divided into parietal (lining wall) and visceral (covering organs) layers
- Peritoneal recesses can be sites of fluid collection

## Normal Abdominal Radiographic Patterns

### Gas Distribution

- **Normal**: Small amount of gas in stomach and colon
- **Small bowel gas**: Minimal in normal state
- **Large bowel gas**: Expected in normal state

### Soft Tissue Masses

- **Liver and spleen**: Most prominent soft tissue masses
- **Kidneys**: Visible as soft tissue densities
- **Bladder**: May be visible when full

### Skeletal Structures

- **Lumbar spine**: Vertebral bodies, disc spaces, and spinous processes
- **Ribs**: Curved structures overlying upper abdomen
- **Pelvic bones**: Lower boundary of abdominal cavity

## Positioning for Abdominal Radiography

### Supine (KUB - Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder)

- Patient lies supine with arms at sides
- Provides good visualization of calcifications, gas patterns, and soft tissue masses
- Commonly used for acute abdomen evaluation

### Erect (Standing)

- Allows assessment of air-fluid levels
- Useful for detecting pneumoperitoneum
- Helps differentiate causes of small bowel obstruction

### Lateral

- Provides additional information about organ location
- Helpful for localizing calcifications and masses
- Often used as complement to frontal views

### Decubitus Views

- Left lateral decubitus: Air rises to right side, allowing visualization of free air
- Right lateral decubitus: Less commonly used

## Variants and Normal Anatomy

### Anatomical Variants

- **Malrotation**: Abnormal rotation of midgut during development
- **Situs inversus**: Mirror image reversal of organ positions
- **Accessory spleens**: Additional splenic tissue
- **Annular pancreas**: Pancreatic tissue encircling duodenum

### Age-Related Changes

- **Infants**: Different organ proportions, less mesenteric fat
- **Elderly**: Increased arterial calcifications, organ atrophy

### Gender Differences

- **Female**: Uterus and ovaries (though not usually visible on plain films)
- **Male**: Different pelvic anatomy

## Clinical Correlations

Understanding abdominal anatomy is essential for:
- Identifying normal vs. abnormal findings
- Recognizing patterns of disease
- Localizing pathology
- Determining appropriate follow-up studies

## Common Anatomical Landmarks

### On Supine Abdomen
- **Liver**: Right upper quadrant mass
- **Spleen**: Left upper quadrant mass
- **Kidneys**: Retroperitoneal structures
- **Psoas muscles**: Adjacent to kidneys
- **Intestinal gas**: Distribution pattern

### On Erect Abdomen
- **Diaphragmatic outlines**: Should be sharp and well-defined
- **Air-fluid levels**: Normal vs. pathological
- **Free air**: Under diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum)

## Summary

Abdominal anatomy is complex with overlapping structures from multiple organ systems. Understanding normal anatomy and its radiological appearance is fundamental to recognizing pathology. Proper positioning and knowledge of anatomical variants are important for accurate interpretation.

## Key Terms

- **Valvulae conniventes**: Permanent mucosal folds in small bowel
- **Haustra**: Sacculations of colon wall
- **Psoas line**: Outline of psoas muscle, should be well-defined
- **Renal line**: Line connecting outer margins of kidneys
- **Carnett's sign**: Pain unchanged or worsened with tensed abdominal muscles (suggests abdominal wall pain)
- **KUB**: Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder radiograph
