# Bowel Obstruction

Bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency requiring prompt radiological diagnosis. Imaging determines the level, cause, and severity including the presence of strangulation.

## Classification

### By Level
- **Small bowel obstruction (SBO)**: Most common (80%); caused by adhesions, hernias
- **Large bowel obstruction (LBO)**: Less common (20%); caused by carcinoma, diverticulitis, volvulus

### By Mechanism
- **Mechanical**: Physical blockage (adhesions, hernias, tumors, volvulus)
- **Functional (ileus)**: No mechanical block; impaired motility
- **Closed-loop**: Two points of obstruction — highest risk of strangulation

## Small Bowel Obstruction

### Causes
1. **Adhesions** (60%): Post-surgical most common
2. **Hernias** (15%): Inguinal, femoral, internal
3. **Crohn's disease**: Stricture or inflammatory mass
4. **Tumors**: Primary small bowel or extrinsic compression
5. **Intussusception**: In adults, usually has lead point (tumor)
6. **Gallstone ileus**: Large gallstone erodes into bowel; air in biliary tree (Rigler's triad)

### Imaging Findings

#### Plain X-Ray (AXR)
- Central dilated small bowel loops (>3 cm)
- Valvulae conniventes cross entire bowel width
- Air-fluid levels at different heights ("step-ladder" pattern)
- Paucity of colonic gas
- Erect film: Multiple air-fluid levels

#### CT (Gold Standard)
- **Transition point**: Where dilated meets decompressed bowel
- **Proximal bowel**: Dilated, fluid-filled or gas-filled
- **Distal bowel**: Collapsed
- **Cause identification**: Adhesive band, hernia, mass

### Strangulation Signs (Surgical Emergency)
- **Reduced bowel wall enhancement**: Ischemia
- **Pneumatosis intestinalis**: Gas in bowel wall
- **Portal venous gas**: Branching lucencies in liver
- **Mesenteric edema**: Fat stranding, haziness
- **Ascites**: Free fluid
- **Whirl sign**: Mesenteric vessels twist around obstructing point
- **Closed-loop**: C-shaped or U-shaped loop with beak at both ends

## Large Bowel Obstruction

### Causes
1. **Colorectal carcinoma** (60%): Most common in left colon
2. **Sigmoid diverticulitis**: Inflammatory stricture
3. **Sigmoid volvulus** (15%)
4. **Cecal volvulus**
5. **Pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome)**: Massive colonic dilation without mechanical cause

### Imaging Findings

#### AXR
- Peripheral dilated large bowel
- Haustral folds (do not cross full width)
- Dilated cecum — normal up to 9 cm; risk of perforation beyond
- Small bowel may or may not be dilated (depends on ileocecal valve competence)

#### CT
- Identifies transition point and cause
- Volvulus: Whirl sign, coffee bean loop
- Carcinoma: Apple-core lesion at transition point
- Diverticulitis: Pericolonic stranding, wall thickening

## Volvulus

### Sigmoid Volvulus
- **Most common volvulus** in Western world
- **Demographics**: Elderly, institutionalized, constipated patients
- **Mechanism**: Sigmoid rotates on mesenteric axis

**AXR:**
- "Coffee bean" sign — inverted U of sigmoid pointing to right upper quadrant
- Absence of rectal gas
- Dilated sigmoid

**CT:**
- "Whirl sign" — mesentery and vessels twisting
- Beaking at point of torsion

### Cecal Volvulus
- **Mechanism**: Cecum rotates, usually anteromedially
- **AXR**: Coffee bean in left upper quadrant or mid-abdomen
- **CT**: Whirl sign at cecal base, small bowel obstruction features

## Gallstone Ileus

### Pathophysiology
- Large gallstone (>2.5 cm) erodes through gallbladder into duodenum
- Stone travels distally and impacts at terminal ileum (narrowest point)

### Rigler's Triad (AXR)
1. **Pneumobilia**: Air in biliary tree
2. **SBO**: Dilated small bowel loops
3. **Ectopic calcification**: Visible gallstone in right iliac fossa

### CT
- Shows all three components of Rigler's triad clearly
- Gallstone visible at transition point

## Ileus (Adynamic Obstruction)

### Causes
- Post-operative (most common)
- Electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia)
- Opioid medications
- Peritonitis, sepsis
- Retroperitoneal hematoma

### Imaging Features
- Diffuse dilation of small and large bowel
- No discrete transition point
- Gas throughout to rectum (unlike mechanical obstruction)
- Air-fluid levels present but uniform throughout

### Ogilvie Syndrome
- Massive colonic pseudo-obstruction without mechanical cause
- AXR/CT: Markedly dilated colon (cecum >10 cm) without obstruction
- Treatment: Neostigmine, colonoscopic decompression

## Management Implications

| Finding | Urgency |
|---------|---------|
| Simple SBO, no strangulation | Trial of conservative management |
| Closed-loop obstruction | Urgent surgery |
| Strangulation signs | Emergency surgery |
| LBO from carcinoma | Urgent decompression/surgery |
| Sigmoid volvulus | Endoscopic decompression then surgery |

Accurate radiological diagnosis of bowel obstruction guides timely surgical intervention and reduces morbidity and mortality.
