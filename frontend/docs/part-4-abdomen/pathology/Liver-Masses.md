# Liver Masses

Liver masses are frequently encountered on abdominal imaging. Accurate characterization using multimodality imaging is essential to differentiate benign from malignant lesions and guide management.

## Imaging Approach

### Multimodality Strategy
1. **Ultrasound**: Initial characterization, Doppler assessment
2. **CT (triphasic)**: Arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases
3. **MRI with hepatobiliary contrast**: Best overall characterization
4. **Nuclear medicine**: HIDA, PET-CT where indicated

### Enhancement Patterns
- **Hypervascular**: HCC, hemangioma, FNH, adenoma, neuroendocrine metastases
- **Hypovascular**: Colorectal metastases, cholangiocarcinoma, most metastases
- **Cystic**: Simple cyst, hydatid, biliary cystadenoma

## Benign Liver Masses

### Simple Hepatic Cyst
- **Prevalence**: Most common benign liver lesion (up to 5% of population)
- **Pathology**: Lined by biliary epithelium; contains clear fluid
- **US**: Anechoic, imperceptible wall, posterior acoustic enhancement
- **CT**: Water density (0-10 HU), no enhancement, smooth thin wall
- **MRI**: T1 hypointense, T2 very bright (fluid signal)
- **Management**: No treatment needed; surgery if symptomatic or large

### Hepatic Hemangioma
- **Most common benign hepatic tumor** (1-20% of population)
- **Pathology**: Vascular malformation filled with blood-filled sinusoids

**Ultrasound:**
- Well-defined echogenic lesion
- Posterior acoustic enhancement
- No vascularity on Doppler (except giant hemangiomas)

**CT:**
- Peripheral nodular enhancement in arterial phase
- Progressive centripetal fill-in on portal and delayed phases
- Isodense to blood pool on all phases

**MRI:**
- T1: Hypointense
- T2: Very bright — "light bulb" sign (very high T2 signal like CSF)
- Enhancement: Same peripheral nodular pattern as CT

**Management:** No treatment needed; biopsy avoided (risk of hemorrhage)

### Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)
- **Second most common benign tumor** in women of childbearing age
- **Pathology**: Hyperplastic hepatocytes arranged around abnormal central artery; Kupffer cells present

**CT:**
- Arterial phase: Intense homogeneous enhancement (except central scar)
- Portal phase: Isodense to liver
- Delayed phase: Central scar shows delayed enhancement

**MRI:**
- T1: Isointense, central scar hypointense
- T2: Isointense, central scar hyperintense
- Hepatobiliary phase (Gd-EOB-DTPA): Hyperintense to liver (Kupffer cell uptake)
- Central scar: Pathognomonic when combined with enhancement pattern

**Management:** No treatment needed; diagnosis with MRI usually avoids biopsy

### Hepatic Adenoma
- **Demographics**: Women on OCP; glycogen storage disease (GSD); beta-catenin mutations
- **Risk**: Spontaneous haemorrhage (especially >5 cm); malignant transformation (beta-catenin subtype)

**CT:**
- Variable; may contain fat or old blood products
- Arterial phase enhancement
- May show heterogeneity (haemorrhage, necrosis)

**MRI Subtype Classification:**
- **HNF1-alpha**: Steatotic (fat-rich) — bright on T1 out-of-phase
- **Beta-catenin**: Malignant potential — GP73 elevated
- **Inflammatory**: T2 hyperintense, marked arterial enhancement

**Management:** Discontinue OCP; surgery if >5 cm or beta-catenin subtype

### Hydatid Cyst (Echinococcus)
- **Organism**: Echinococcus granulosus (cystic) or E. multilocularis (alveolar)
- **Epidemiology**: Endemic in sheep-farming regions, Mediterranean, Middle East

**CT/MRI Features (cystic type):**
- Unilocular cyst with calcified wall
- "Water lily" sign: Floating membranes from collapsed endocyst
- Daughter cysts: Multiple smaller cysts within larger cyst
- Pericyst calcification: Eggshell calcification

**Serological tests:** ELISA, Western blot for confirmation

**Management:** PAIR procedure (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) or surgery; albendazole

## Malignant Liver Masses

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

**Background:**
- Most common primary liver malignancy worldwide
- 90% arise in cirrhotic liver (hepatitis B/C, alcoholic, NASH)
- AFP elevated in ~70%

**CT/MRI Hallmark:**
- **Arterial phase enhancement** (hypervascular)
- **Portal venous washout** (becomes hypodense compared to liver)
- **Capsule enhancement**: Delayed phase rim enhancement

**LIRADS Classification (LI-RADS):**
- LR-1: Definitely benign
- LR-2: Probably benign
- LR-3: Intermediate
- LR-4: Probably HCC
- LR-5: Definitely HCC (major criteria met)
- LR-M: Probably malignant, not HCC-specific

**Complications:**
- Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT)
- Satellite nodules
- Hepatic vein invasion
- Bile duct invasion

### Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
- **Second most common** primary liver malignancy
- **CT**: Peripheral, infiltrative, or mass-forming; **delayed progressive enhancement** (fibrous stroma)
- **MRI**: T2 variable, restricted diffusion, ductal dilation proximal to mass
- **Differentiation from HCC**: No washout; delayed enhancement; CA 19-9 elevated

### Liver Metastases
- **Most common hepatic malignancy** in Western countries

**Common Primary Sources:**
| Primary | Enhancement Pattern |
|---------|-------------------|
| Colorectal | Hypovascular, rim enhancement |
| Neuroendocrine | Hypervascular |
| Breast | Variable, hypovascular |
| Renal cell | Hypervascular |
| Gastric/pancreatic | Hypovascular |
| Melanoma | Variable |

**CT Features:**
- Multiple, bilateral distribution
- Hypovascular: Best seen portal venous phase as hypodense lesions
- Hypervascular: Best seen arterial phase
- "Target sign": Peripheral enhancement with central necrosis

**MRI:**
- DWI: Restricted diffusion in most metastases
- Hepatobiliary phase: Hypointense defects in enhanced liver

## Key Differentiating Features

| Feature | HCC | FNH | Adenoma | Hemangioma | Metastasis |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|------------|-----------|
| Background | Cirrhosis | Normal liver | Young women | Any | Known primary |
| AFP | Elevated | Normal | Normal | Normal | CEA/CA19-9 |
| Arterial enhancement | Yes (washout) | Yes (no washout) | Yes | Peripheral nodular | Variable |
| Central scar | Uncommon | Yes | No | No | No |
| T2 signal | Moderately bright | Slightly bright | Variable | Very bright | Moderately bright |

Accurate characterization of liver masses through a systematic multimodality approach guides appropriate management and avoids unnecessary intervention in benign lesions.
