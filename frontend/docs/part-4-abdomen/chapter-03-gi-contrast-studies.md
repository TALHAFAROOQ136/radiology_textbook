# Gastrointestinal Contrast Studies

Gastrointestinal contrast studies use radiopaque or radiolucent agents to outline the GI tract lumen, allowing evaluation of mucosal detail, motility, and structural abnormalities. Despite the rise of endoscopy and CT, these studies remain valuable in specific clinical scenarios.

## Contrast Agents

### Barium Sulfate
- **Properties**: Inert, not absorbed, provides excellent mucosal coating
- **Concentration**: High-density for double-contrast, low-density for single-contrast
- **Contraindications**: Suspected perforation (use water-soluble instead), risk of aspiration

### Water-Soluble Contrast
- **Agents**: Gastrografin (diatrizoate), iohexol (non-ionic, safer for aspiration)
- **Indications**: Suspected perforation, pre-operative assessment, bowel anastomosis leaks
- **Disadvantage**: Poor mucosal coating compared to barium
- **Warning**: Gastrografin is hyperosmolar — dangerous if aspirated or used in neonates

### Double-Contrast Technique
- **Principle**: Thin barium coat + gas distension = superior mucosal detail
- **Gas agents**: Effervescent granules or insufflation
- **Advantage**: Detects small mucosal lesions, polyps, early cancer

## Upper GI Series

### Technique
1. Patient fasts overnight
2. Effervescent granules taken (gas distension)
3. High-density barium swallowed
4. Images taken in multiple positions
5. Fluoroscopic assessment of swallowing, motility, mucosal pattern

### Normal Anatomy Assessment
- **Esophagus**: Smooth, distensible, peristalsis visible
- **Gastroesophageal junction**: Z-line, hiatus
- **Stomach**: Rugal folds, peristaltic waves, pylorus
- **Duodenum**: Duodenal cap, C-loop, papilla of Vater

### Common Abnormalities

#### Esophagus
- **Strictures**: Smooth (benign) vs. irregular (malignant)
- **Achalasia**: Smooth tapering at GEJ — "bird beak" appearance, dilated esophagus
- **Esophageal varices**: Serpiginous filling defects in lower esophagus
- **Hiatal hernia**: Gastric mucosa above diaphragm

#### Stomach
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Niche (crater) on lesser curve, Hampton line
- **Gastric carcinoma**: Irregular filling defect, mucosal destruction
- **Linitis plastica**: Rigid, narrowed "leather bottle" stomach (diffuse carcinoma)

## Barium Swallow (Esophagram)

### Indications
- Dysphagia evaluation
- Suspected esophageal perforation (use water-soluble first)
- Pre-operative assessment
- Postoperative leak assessment

### Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study
- **Purpose**: Evaluate oropharyngeal swallowing mechanics
- **Phases**: Oral preparatory, oral, pharyngeal, esophageal
- **Findings**: Aspiration, penetration, pooling, delayed clearance

### Specific Findings
- **Pharyngeal pouch (Zenker's diverticulum)**: Posterior herniation at Killian's dehiscence
- **Cricopharyngeal bar**: Prominent posterior indentation at C5-6 level
- **Webs**: Thin shelf-like protrusions, often anterior (Plummer-Vinson syndrome)

## Small Bowel Follow-Through (SBFT)

### Technique
- Patient drinks large volume of dilute barium (600-800 mL)
- Serial films taken every 15-30 minutes
- Fluoroscopy of terminal ileum
- Total examination time: 2-4 hours

### Normal Findings
- **Jejunum**: Many valvulae conniventes (feathery appearance), left-sided
- **Ileum**: Fewer folds, smoother, right-sided, terminal ileum assessment crucial
- **Transit time**: 2-4 hours to cecum

### Abnormal Findings
- **Crohn's disease**: Skip lesions, cobblestone mucosa, rose-thorn ulcers, string sign of Kantor
- **Celiac disease**: Moulage sign, fold reversal (more folds in ileum, fewer in jejunum)
- **Small bowel tumors**: Filling defects, mucosal disruption
- **Adhesions**: Fixed loop, angulation, delayed transit

## Small Bowel Enteroclysis

### Technique
- Nasoduodenal tube placement past ligament of Treitz
- Direct infusion of barium and methylcellulose
- Superior mucosal detail to SBFT

### Advantages over SBFT
- Better distension and mucosal coating
- More reliable detection of subtle lesions
- Not dependent on patient cooperation

## Barium Enema

### Technique
#### Single-Contrast
- Low-density barium instilled via rectal tube
- Good for obstruction assessment, fistulae

#### Double-Contrast (Air-Contrast)
- Barium coating followed by air insufflation
- Superior mucosal detail
- Better polyp detection

### Normal Anatomy
- **Cecum**: Rounded, right iliac fossa, appendix may fill
- **Ascending colon**: Haustral folds
- **Hepatic flexure**: Relationship to liver
- **Transverse colon**: Most mobile segment
- **Splenic flexure**: High left upper quadrant
- **Sigmoid**: Redundant S-shaped loop
- **Rectum**: Sacral curve, valves of Houston

### Common Abnormalities
- **Colorectal carcinoma**: "Apple core" lesion — shouldered annular narrowing
- **Diverticular disease**: Flask-shaped outpouchings, mainly sigmoid
- **Ulcerative colitis**: Loss of haustration, lead pipe colon, backwash ileitis
- **Crohn's colitis**: Skip lesions, deep ulcers, fistulae
- **Polyps**: Filling defects on double-contrast
- **Volvulus**: Twisted loop (omega loop for sigmoid; coffee bean sign)

## Water-Soluble Enema

### Indications
- Suspected colorectal perforation
- Post-operative anastomotic leak
- Neonatal bowel obstruction (Hirschsprung's disease assessment)
- Meconium ileus treatment

### Gastrografin Enema in Neonates
- **Hirschsprung's disease**: Transition zone between dilated proximal and narrow distal colon
- **Meconium ileus**: Microcolon, filling of inspissated meconium pellets
- **Meconium plug syndrome**: Filling defect in colon

## Fistulography

### Technique
- Contrast injected directly into fistula opening
- Defines track, communication with bowel/bladder/skin

### Common Applications
- **Enterocutaneous fistula**: Track from bowel to skin
- **Colovesical fistula**: Bowel-bladder communication (air in bladder on CT)
- **Perianal fistula**: Define anatomy before surgery

## Defecography

### Technique
- Barium paste instilled into rectum
- Dynamic imaging during simulated defecation
- Assess anorectal angle, pelvic floor descent

### Indications
- Obstructed defecation
- Rectal prolapse assessment
- Rectocele, intussusception

## Radiation Dose Considerations

| Study | Typical Effective Dose |
|-------|----------------------|
| Barium swallow | 1-2 mSv |
| Upper GI series | 3-6 mSv |
| Small bowel SBFT | 3-5 mSv |
| Barium enema (DC) | 7-8 mSv |

GI contrast studies, when appropriately selected and performed, provide valuable anatomical and functional information that complements endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging.
