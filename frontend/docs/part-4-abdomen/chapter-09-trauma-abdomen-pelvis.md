- Apply splenic and hepatic injury grading scales
- Recognize renal trauma on CT
- Identify pelvic fracture patterns and hemorrhage

---

## 31.1 FAST Ultrasound Examination

### Purpose

**FAST** = **F**ocused **A**ssessment with **S**onography in **T**rauma

- Rapid bedside ultrasound examination for hemoperitoneum and pericardial effusion
- Performed by emergency physicians and surgeons
- Part of primary survey in trauma (ATLS)

### Four Standard Views

| View | Region Assessed | Looking For |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Perihepatic (RUQ)** | Morrison's pouch (hepatorenal recess) | Free fluid between liver and right kidney |
| **Perisplenic (LUQ)** | Splenorenal recess and left paracolic gutter | Free fluid around spleen |
| **Pelvic (Transverse + Sagittal)** | Pouch of Douglas / retrovesical pouch | Free fluid in pelvis |
| **Pericardial (Subxiphoid)** | Pericardial sac | Pericardial effusion / hemopericardium |

### Interpretation

**Positive FAST (free fluid present):**
- Anechoic (black) fluid in dependent spaces
- Morrison's pouch is most sensitive location for small amounts of free fluid

**Negative FAST:**
- Does not exclude solid organ injury or injury without hemorrhage
- FAST sensitivity for intra-abdominal injury: ~78-86%

### Extended FAST (eFAST)

Adds bilateral chest views:
- Pneumothorax: absence of lung sliding
- Hemothorax: basal fluid

### FAST Limitations

- Operator dependent
- Cannot identify the source of bleeding
- Cannot detect retroperitoneal hemorrhage
- Cannot detect bowel or mesenteric injuries
- Suboptimal in obese patients or subcutaneous emphysema

## 31.2 CT Trauma Protocols

### Indications for CT Abdomen/Pelvis in Trauma

- Significant mechanism (high-energy MVA, fall from height)
- Positive FAST or clinical concern for abdominal injury
- Hemodynamically stable patient
- Abdominal tenderness, seat belt sign, distension

**Hemodynamically unstable patient:**
- NOT for CT
- FAST positive → immediate surgery
- OR direct to intervention (IR) if available

### CT Technique

**Standard trauma CT abdomen/pelvis:**
- IV contrast (portal venous phase: 70-80 seconds delay)
- Includes chest CT in full trauma series
- Arterial phase added if vascular injury suspected

**Triple-contrast CT (historical):**
- IV + oral + rectal contrast
- Largely replaced by single IV contrast phase

**Arterial phase:**
- For detecting active arterial hemorrhage ("blush" of contrast extravasation)
- Active extravasation = bright spot outside vessel at arterial density (>100 HU)

### CT Reporting Priorities in Trauma

1. **Free fluid:** Location and estimated volume
2. **Solid organ injuries:** Grade injuries (see below)
3. **Active hemorrhage:** Arterial blush
4. **Hollow organ injuries:** Pneumoperitoneum, bowel wall thickening
5. **Mesenteric injury:** Stranding, hematoma
6. **Vascular injuries:** Aortic, IVC
7. **Retroperitoneal:** Pancreatic, adrenal, duodenal
8. **Skeletal:** Pelvic, spine fractures

## 31.3 Splenic Injuries

### AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) Grading

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| I | Subcapsular hematoma &lt;10%; capsular laceration &lt;1 cm |
| II | Subcapsular hematoma 10–50%; parenchymal laceration 1–3 cm |
| III | Subcapsular hematoma >50%; laceration >3 cm; vascular injury contained |
| IV | Active bleeding within splenic parenchyma; segmental devascularization |
| V | Completely shattered spleen; hilar vascular injury with devascularization |

### CT Findings of Splenic Injury

- **Subcapsular hematoma:** Crescent of lower density blood between capsule and parenchyma
- **Laceration:** Linear low density through spleen
- **Active hemorrhage:** "Blush" — hyperdense area (contrast extravasation) within or outside spleen
- **Perisplenic hematoma:** Blood around spleen in left upper quadrant
- **Sentinel clot:** High-density (acute) clot adjacent to injured organ

### Management

- Grade I-II: Non-operative management (NOM) in stable patients
- Grade III-IV: Often managed by angioembolization (interventional radiology)
- Grade V or hemodynamic instability: Emergency splenectomy
- Delayed splenic rupture: Can occur up to 2 weeks post-injury (even with Grade I)

## 31.4 Hepatic Injuries

### AAST Liver Injury Scale

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| I | Subcapsular hematoma &lt;10%; capsular laceration &lt;1 cm |
| II | Subcapsular hematoma 10–50%; laceration 1–3 cm |
| III | Subcapsular hematoma >50%; laceration >3 cm |
| IV | Parenchymal disruption 25–75% of hepatic lobe |
| V | Parenchymal disruption >75% of lobe; vascular injury to hepatic veins/IVC |
| VI | Hepatic avulsion |

### CT Findings

- Lacerations: Irregular low-density linear areas
- Subcapsular hematoma: Peripheral collection
- Perihepatic blood in Morrison's pouch
- Active hemorrhage: Arterial blush
- Bile duct injury: Fluid around porta hepatis (biloma)

### Management

- Grade I-III: Mostly NOM in stable patients; close observation
- Grade IV-V with active bleeding: Angioembolization or surgery
- Bile leak: May require ERCP or percutaneous drainage

## 31.5 Renal Trauma

### AAST Renal Injury Scale

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| I | Contusion; subcapsular hematoma |
| II | Non-expanding perirenal hematoma; cortical laceration &lt;1 cm |
| III | Cortical laceration >1 cm without collecting system |
| IV | Laceration into collecting system; renal artery/vein injury |
| V | Shattered kidney; avulsion of renal pedicle |

### CT Findings

**Contusion:**
- Geographic low density on nephrographic phase
- Reduced enhancement

**Laceration:**
- Linear defect through renal parenchyma
- Perirenal hematoma

**Collecting system injury:**
- Urinary extravasation: Contrast (on delayed phase) outside collecting system
- "Urinoma" — delayed collection of urine

**Vascular injury:**
- Absent or reduced perfusion → main renal artery injury
- "Rim sign": thin cortical enhancement preserved due to capsular vessels (main renal artery occlusion)

**Delayed phase (10 minutes):** Essential for detecting collecting system disruption

### Management

- Grade I-III: NOM in stable patients
- Grade IV: Selective angioembolization for active bleeding; ureteral stenting for urinary extravasation
- Grade V: Emergency surgery

## 31.6 Pelvic Fractures and Hemorrhage

### Pelvic Fracture Classification

**Tile/OTA Classification:**
- Type A: Stable (posterior arch intact)
- Type B: Partially stable (rotational instability, posterior intact)
- Type C: Unstable (posterior arch disrupted; vertical instability)

**Young and Burgess Classification (by mechanism):**
- Lateral compression (LC): Most common; compression of pelvic ring
- Anteroposterior compression (APC): "Open book"; pubic diastasis
- Vertical shear (VS): Unstable; vertical displacement
- Combined mechanism (CMI)

### Hemorrhage in Pelvic Fractures

**Life-threatening hemorrhage in unstable pelvic fractures:**
- Venous bleeding: Presacral venous plexus (most common)
- Arterial bleeding: Superior gluteal artery (most common artery injured), internal iliac, obturator

**CT findings:**
- Active arterial "blush" in pelvis — extravasation of contrast
- Large pelvic hematoma (retroperitoneal)
- Free fluid in pelvis
- Fracture pattern predicting risk of hemorrhage (APC III, VS)

### Management of Pelvic Hemorrhage

1. **Pelvic binder:** External compression to reduce pelvic volume and tamponade venous bleeding
2. **Resuscitation:** Massive transfusion protocol
3. **Angioembolization (IR):** For arterial bleeding identified on CT; superior gluteal artery embolization
4. **Preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP):** For venous bleeding when IR not immediately available
5. **External fixation:** Orthopedic stabilization

## 31.7 Bladder Rupture

### Types

**Extraperitoneal bladder rupture (most common ~60%):**
- Associated with pelvic fracture
- Contrast extravasation into perivesical space on CT cystography
- Irregular "flame-shaped" extravasation at base of bladder

**Intraperitoneal bladder rupture (~40%):**
- Blunt trauma to distended bladder (direct blow to full bladder)
- Contrast tracks around bowel loops in peritoneal cavity
- Requires surgical repair

**Combined: ~10%**

### CT Cystography

- Retrograde filling of bladder with dilute contrast (300-350 mL)
- CT before and after instillation
- Compare to retrograde cystogram (X-ray equivalent)
- More sensitive than passive filling (delayed phase from IV contrast)

### Urethral Injury

- Anterior or posterior urethra
- Male > female (female urethra short and mobile)
- Contraindication to urethral catheterization if suspected
- Retrograde urethrogram (RUG) to assess

## Key Points Summary

1. **FAST** — rapid bedside assessment for hemoperitoneum; Morrison's pouch most sensitive; negative FAST does NOT exclude injury

2. **CT trauma protocol** requires hemodynamic stability; arterial phase detects active arterial extravasation ("blush")

3. **Splenic injury** — Grade I-II managed non-operatively; Grade III-V may need angioembolization or surgery

4. **Delayed phase CT** (10 min) is essential for detecting urinary collecting system injuries (urinary extravasation)

5. **Pelvic fractures** with "open book" pattern (APC type) risk major hemorrhage from pre-sacral veins and internal iliac artery

6. **Intraperitoneal bladder rupture** — contrast around bowel loops on cystography; requires surgical repair
