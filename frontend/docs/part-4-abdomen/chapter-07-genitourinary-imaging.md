## 28.1 Kidney Stones and Urolithiasis

### Epidemiology

- Lifetime prevalence ~10-15% in Western populations
- Males > females (2:1)
- Recurrence rate: 50% within 10 years

### Types of Kidney Stones

| Type | Frequency | Appearance on CT | Appearance on X-ray |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Calcium oxalate | 75-80% | High density (400-600 HU) | Radiopaque |
| Struvite (infection stones) | 10% | High density | Radiopaque; "staghorn" |
| Uric acid | 5-8% | Low density (200-400 HU) | Radiolucent (invisible) |
| Cystine | 1-2% | Moderate density | Faintly radiopaque |
| Pure calcium phosphate | 5% | Very high density | Radiopaque |

### CT KUB (Non-Contrast CT of Urinary Tract)

**Gold standard for urolithiasis** — sensitivity ~98%, specificity ~97%

**Technique:**
- Non-contrast CT
- Thin slices (1–3 mm)
- Entire urinary tract from kidneys to bladder

**Findings on CT:**
- Ureteric stone: bright white density within ureter
- Soft tissue rim sign: halo of soft tissue surrounding stone (ureter wall)
- Periureteric stranding: fat stranding around ureter at stone level (indicates obstruction/edema)
- Hydronephrosis: dilated renal pelvis and calyces
- Perinephric stranding: fat stranding around kidney (indicates obstructive uropathy)

**Reporting elements for ureteric stones:**
- Location (upper/mid/lower ureter)
- Size (HU attenuation and diameter)
- Degree of hydronephrosis
- Signs of infection/forniceal rupture

### Plain Radiography (KUB)

- Detects only radiopaque stones (calcium stones) — approximately 90% of stones are radiopaque
- Useful for follow-up of known calcium stones
- Limited by: overlapping bowel gas, small stone size, uric acid stones invisible

### Ultrasound in Urolithiasis

- **Advantages:** No radiation; assesses hydronephrosis; suitable in pregnancy and children
- **Limitations:** Cannot reliably detect ureteric stones; misses small stones; gas interference
- **Main use:** Renal calculi, hydronephrosis, monitoring in pregnancy
- Ureteric jet on Doppler: absence suggests obstruction

### Intravenous Urogram (IVU) — Historical

- Now largely replaced by CT urography and non-contrast CT
- Still used in some settings
- Iodinated contrast IV → images at 5, 15, 30 min → contrast-filled urinary tract visualized

### Management by Stone Size

| Stone Size | Expected Passage | Management |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| &lt;4 mm | 80% pass spontaneously | Medical expulsive therapy |
| 4–6 mm | 50-60% pass | Conservative management |
| 6–10 mm | &lt;50% pass | Consider intervention |
| >10 mm | Unlikely to pass | ESWL or ureteroscopy |
| >20 mm (staghorn) | Surgery | Percutaneous nephrolithotomy |

## 28.2 Hydronephrosis and Urinary Obstruction

### Definition

Hydronephrosis = dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to urinary obstruction.

### Grading (Society of Fetal Urology — SFU)

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Grade 1 | Mild: renal pelvis visible only |
| Grade 2 | Moderate: few calyces visible |
| Grade 3 | Moderate-severe: all calyces visible |
| Grade 4 | Severe: parenchymal thinning begins |

### Causes of Hydronephrosis

**Intrinsic obstruction:**
- Ureteric stone (most common)
- Stricture (TB, post-radiation, surgery)
- Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of ureter

**Extrinsic compression:**
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis
- Pelvic malignancy (cervical, prostate, bladder cancer)
- Gravid uterus (physiological in pregnancy)
- Lymph node metastases

**Functional/at junction:**
- Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction
- Vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) obstruction

### Ultrasound of Hydronephrosis

- Dilated anechoic renal pelvis and calyces
- Quantify degree of parenchymal thinning
- Cannot usually identify the cause (ureteric stone not seen reliably)
- Assess resistive index (RI) on Doppler: RI >0.70 suggests obstruction

### CT Urography

- Three-phase study: unenhanced + nephrographic phase + excretory phase (delayed)
- Shows entire urinary tract opacified
- Identifies site and cause of obstruction
- Detection of urothelial tumors, strictures, calculi

### Diuresis Renography (MAG3 Nuclear Scan)

- Assesses differential renal function
- Detects obstruction (slow drainage even with diuretic stimulus)
- Used for UPJ obstruction assessment and post-treatment follow-up

## 28.3 Renal Masses — Bosniak Classification

### Simple Renal Cysts

- Common incidental finding
- Classic US: anechoic, thin wall, posterior acoustic enhancement, no internal structure
- Classic CT: water density (0–20 HU), smooth thin wall, no enhancement
- Bosniak I: benign; no follow-up

### Bosniak Classification

System to classify renal cystic masses based on CT features:

| Category | Description | Malignancy Risk | Management |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **I** | Simple cyst: thin wall, water density, no enhancement | Negligible | No follow-up |
| **II** | Minimally complex: hairline septa, minimal calcification, high-density cysts &lt;3 cm | &lt;5% | No follow-up |
| **IIF** | More complex: multiple septa, thick calcification, high-density cysts ≥3 cm, no enhancing component | ~20% | Follow-up CT at 6 months, then annually |
| **III** | Indeterminate: thick irregular septa with measurable enhancement | ~50% | Surgical excision or ablation |
| **IV** | Clearly malignant: solid enhancing components | >90% | Surgical excision |

**Enhancement** = increase in HU by ≥15 after IV contrast

### Solid Renal Masses

**Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):**
- Most common malignant renal tumor in adults
- Types: Clear cell (most common, most vascular), papillary, chromophobe
- CT: Solid, enhancing renal mass; clear cell = very avidly enhancing
- May extend into renal vein and IVC (venous tumor thrombus)
- Paraneoplastic syndromes: polycythemia, hypercalcemia, Stauffer syndrome

**Angiomyolipoma (AML):**
- Benign; fat-containing renal mass
- CT: Macroscopic fat (-10 to -30 HU) within renal mass = diagnostic
- Association with tuberous sclerosis (multiple bilateral AML)
- Risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) if >4 cm

**Oncocytoma:**
- Benign
- CT: May show central stellate scar; spoke-wheel angiographic pattern
- Cannot reliably differentiate from chromophobe RCC → surgery required

**Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC/Urothelial Carcinoma):**
- Arises from collecting system (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder)
- CT: Filling defect or wall thickening in renal pelvis on CT urography
- Associated with smoking, occupational exposure, analgesic nephropathy

## 28.4 Bladder Imaging

### Ultrasound of the Bladder

- Non-invasive, no radiation
- Assessment of bladder wall and volume
- Detects large masses, calculi, diverticula
- Post-void residual measurement (normal &lt;50 mL)

### CT of the Bladder

**CT Urography (excretory phase):**
- Best CT technique for bladder evaluation
- Bladder fully distended with contrast
- Detects TCC as filling defects within bladder lumen

**MRI Pelvis (mpMRI):**
- Gold standard for bladder cancer local staging
- Assesses depth of muscle invasion (T staging)
- T2-weighted images: normal muscle is dark; tumor is intermediate signal
- DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) highlights tumor

### MRI Bladder Staging

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| T1 | Lamina propria only |
| T2a | Superficial muscle |
| T2b | Deep muscle |
| T3a | Microscopic perivesical fat |
| T3b | Macroscopic perivesical fat |
| T4 | Adjacent organs/pelvic wall |

### Cystography / CT Cystography

- Retrograde filling of bladder with contrast
- Assessment for bladder rupture (trauma)
- Detects fistulae

## 28.5 CT Urography

### Indications

- Hematuria (investigation for urothelial malignancy)
- Recurrent UTIs
- Follow-up of urothelial malignancy
- Comprehensive evaluation of entire urinary tract

### Technique

**Three phases:**
1. **Unenhanced phase:** Detects calculi (dense); baseline density of lesions
2. **Nephrographic phase** (90 seconds): Renal parenchyma uniformly enhanced; best for solid renal masses
3. **Excretory/urographic phase** (7-10 minutes): Collecting system and ureters opacified with contrast; urothelial assessment

**Split-bolus technique:** Reduces radiation by combining phases

### CT Urography Interpretation

- Kidneys: Mass lesions, cortical thickness, enhancement
- Urinary tract: Filling defects, strictures, dilatation
- Bladder: Filling defects, wall thickening
- Surrounding structures: Lymph nodes, adjacent organs

## Key Points Summary

1. **Non-contrast CT** is the gold standard for urolithiasis (98% sensitivity); uric acid stones are invisible on plain radiography but visible on CT

2. **Bosniak classification** stratifies renal cystic masses: Bosniak I–II = benign; IIF = follow-up; III = surgical excision considered; IV = malignant

3. **Macroscopic fat** on CT within a renal mass = angiomyolipoma (benign); negative HU values (-10 to -30)

4. **RCC** — avid contrast enhancement (especially clear cell type); check for venous tumor thrombus extending into IVC

5. **CT urography** (3-phase) is the primary investigation for hematuria and urothelial malignancy evaluation

6. **Hydronephrosis** — graded I-IV; ultrasound is first line; CT urography for cause identification
