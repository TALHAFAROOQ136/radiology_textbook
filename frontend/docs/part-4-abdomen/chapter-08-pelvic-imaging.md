## 30.1 Pelvic Ultrasound

### Techniques

**Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS):**
- Probe on lower abdomen through full bladder (acoustic window)
- Wide field of view; overview of pelvic anatomy
- Limited resolution compared to transvaginal

**Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS):**
- Probe inserted into vagina; closer to pelvic organs
- Superior resolution for uterus and ovaries
- Requires empty or partially full bladder
- Better for: endometrial assessment, small ovarian pathology, early pregnancy

**Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS):**
- Prostate assessment in men
- Guided prostate biopsies

### Normal Uterus

- Pear-shaped; fundus, body, cervix
- Size: 7-9 cm × 3-5 cm (reproductive age)
- Endometrium: echogenicity varies with menstrual cycle
  - Early proliferative: thin, echogenic
  - Pre-ovulatory: "triple layer" appearance
  - Secretory: thick, echogenic
  - Postmenopausal endometrium: &lt;4 mm (thin, atrophic)

### Normal Ovaries

- Size: 2.5–3 × 2 cm in reproductive age
- Contain follicles (small anechoic cysts)
- Dominant follicle: up to 25-30 mm pre-ovulation
- Postmenopausal: small, poorly visible

---

## 30.2 Gynecological Imaging

### Uterine Fibroids (Leiomyomata)

- Most common uterine tumor in women of reproductive age (20-40%)
- Benign smooth muscle tumors

**Classification by location:**
- **Intramural:** Within myometrium (most common)
- **Submucosal:** Beneath endometrium (most symptomatic; cause heavy bleeding)
- **Subserosal:** On outer surface of uterus (may become pedunculated)

**Ultrasound:**
- Hypoechoic, well-defined nodule(s) within uterus
- Acoustic shadowing from calcified fibroids
- Enlarged, irregular uterus
- Saline-infusion sonography (SIS/hysterosonogram): better evaluation of submucosal fibroids

**MRI:**
- Low T2 signal (dense fibrous tissue) — classic feature
- Subserosal vs. intramural vs. submucosal differentiation
- Pre-treatment planning (uterine fibroid embolization — UFE)

### Endometrial Pathology

**Endometrial hyperplasia:**
- Thickened endometrium (>4 mm postmenopausal on TVS — high-risk threshold)
- Irregular endometrium
- Requires histological confirmation (biopsy)

**Endometrial carcinoma:**
- Postmenopausal bleeding — most common presentation
- TVS: thickened, irregular endometrium
- MRI: best for staging — myometrial invasion depth (T staging)

**MRI staging of endometrial carcinoma:**
- T1: endometrium only
- T2: cervical stromal invasion
- T3: extrauterine extension
- T4: bladder or rectal involvement

### Ovarian Cysts

**Simple cysts:**
- Anechoic, thin-walled, posterior acoustic enhancement
- In reproductive age: most are functional (follicular or corpus luteum)
- Management by O-RADS US risk score

**Common ovarian cysts:**

| Type | US Features | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| Follicular cyst | Simple, &lt;3 cm | Normal — resolve |
| Corpus luteum | Thick wall, may have internal echoes | Usually resolve in 6-8 weeks |
| Dermoid (mature teratoma) | "Tip of the iceberg" sign; echogenic fat; hair; Rokitansky nodule | Surgical excision |
| Endometrioma | "Ground glass" echogenicity; uniform low-level internal echoes | Gynecology referral |
| Hemorrhagic cyst | Complex with reticular/lace-like pattern | Follow-up 6-12 weeks |

### Ovarian Torsion

**Clinical:** Acute pelvic pain; nausea; tender adnexal mass

**Ultrasound findings:**
- Enlarged, edematous ovary (>4 cm)
- Peripheral displacement of follicles ("string of pearls")
- Ovary may appear heterogeneous if hemorrhagic infarction
- Absent or diminished blood flow on Doppler (present flow does NOT exclude torsion)
- Free fluid in pelvis

**Note:** Normal Doppler flow does NOT exclude torsion — diagnosis is clinical and surgical

### Ovarian Cancer Imaging

**O-RADS (Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System):**
System 1-5 for malignancy risk:
- O-RADS 1: normal; O-RADS 5: high risk

**Ultrasound features suggesting malignancy:**
- Solid or solid-cystic mass
- Thick, irregular septa (>3 mm)
- Papillary projections
- Bilateral lesions
- Ascites

**CT for staging:**
- Peritoneal implants, omental cake
- Lymph node metastases
- Liver metastases
- Ascites

### Pelvic MRI for Gynecological Cancer

**Cervical carcinoma MRI staging:**
- T2-weighted MRI: best tissue contrast
- Tumour appears as intermediate signal within dark cervical stroma
- Stage IB: confined to cervix
- Stage IIB: parametrial invasion (disrupts dark T2 ring)
- Lymph node assessment: size and signal

## 30.3 Obstetric Ultrasound Basics

### First Trimester Ultrasound

**Gestational sac:** First sonographic evidence of intrauterine pregnancy (~4.5-5 weeks)
- Intradecidual sign: sac in endometrium
- Double decidual sign: two echogenic rings

**Yolk sac:** Visible ~5.5 weeks; confirms intrauterine pregnancy

**Embryo:** Visible ~6 weeks; heartbeat ~6-6.5 weeks (should be visible if CRL ≥7 mm)

**Crown-rump length (CRL):**
- Most accurate gestational age measurement (±5-7 days)
- Measured from 6-13 weeks

**Nuchal translucency (NT):**
- 11-13+6 weeks
- Normal &lt;3.5 mm
- Increased NT: risk for chromosomal abnormalities (Down syndrome, trisomies)
- Combined with serum markers (PAPP-A, beta-hCG) = combined first-trimester screen

**Ectopic pregnancy:**
- No intrauterine pregnancy + adnexal mass
- Free fluid in pouch of Douglas
- Adnexal ring of echogenicity around non-intrauterine gestation
- Emergency — risk of rupture

### Second Trimester Anatomy Scan (18-22 weeks)

**Systematic assessment:**
- Fetal biometry: biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL)
- Estimated fetal weight from biometry
- Fetal anatomy: brain, face, heart (4-chamber view), spine, abdomen, limbs
- Placenta: location, posterior/anterior
- Amniotic fluid: deepest pool or AFI

**Placenta previa:**
- Placenta overlying or adjacent to internal os
- Low-lying: &lt;2 cm from internal os
- Complete previa: covers os

**Common fetal anomalies detected:**
- Neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly)
- Cardiac defects (ventricular septal defect, hypoplastic left heart)
- Abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele)
- Chromosomal markers (echogenic bowel, choroid plexus cysts)

## 30.4 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

### Definition

Infection of the upper genital tract (uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries).

### Ultrasound Features

**Mild PID:**
- Uterine tenderness on probe movement ("chandelier sign")
- Endometrial fluid or thickening
- Free fluid in pelvis

**Severe PID — Tubo-Ovarian Abscess (TOA):**
- Complex adnexal mass
- Thick-walled; irregular internal echoes
- May not be distinguishable from ovary
- Bilateral in 30%
- Free fluid (pus) in pouch of Douglas

**CT findings (if US equivocal):**
- Thickened, enhancing fallopian tubes
- Complex adnexal mass with ring enhancement
- Parametrial fat stranding
- Free fluid

### Complications

- Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) — requires IV antibiotics; may need percutaneous drainage
- Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome: perihepatitis; liver capsule enhancement on CT (right upper quadrant pain from PID)
- Chronic PID → infertility (tubal scarring)

## 30.5 MRI of the Pelvis

### Advantages of MRI

- No radiation
- Excellent soft tissue contrast
- Multiplanar imaging
- Gold standard for: endometrial carcinoma staging, cervical carcinoma staging, uterine fibroid characterization, rectal carcinoma staging, prostate MRI (mpMRI)

### Pelvic MRI Protocol

**Key sequences:**
- **T2-weighted:** Best tissue contrast; anatomy; fibroids, cancer, normal structures
- **T1-weighted:** Fat; hemorrhage; post-contrast enhancement
- **DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging):** Tumor detection and characterization; restricted diffusion in cancer
- **DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhancement):** Perfusion; cancer enhancement kinetics

### Prostate MRI (mpMRI)

**Clinical use:** Detect and stage prostate cancer before and after biopsy

**PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System):**
- PI-RADS 1-2: benign; no biopsy
- PI-RADS 3: intermediate; consider biopsy
- PI-RADS 4-5: suspicious; targeted biopsy

**Zones of the prostate:**
- Peripheral zone (PZ): where most cancers occur; low T2 signal = suspicious
- Transition zone (TZ): BPH; heterogeneous; T2 signal variable

## Key Points Summary

1. **TVS** provides superior resolution for uterine and ovarian pathology compared to transabdominal US

2. **Postmenopausal endometrium >4 mm** on TVS is high-risk threshold for endometrial pathology — biopsy required

3. **Ovarian torsion** — enlarged ovary; normal Doppler does NOT exclude torsion; diagnosis is clinical

4. **Dermoid cyst** — "tip of the iceberg" sign; echogenic fat component with Rokitansky nodule

5. **MRI pelvis** is gold standard for gynecological cancer staging (endometrial, cervical carcinoma)

6. **TOA (tubo-ovarian abscess)** — complex adnexal mass from PID; requires IV antibiotics ± drainage
