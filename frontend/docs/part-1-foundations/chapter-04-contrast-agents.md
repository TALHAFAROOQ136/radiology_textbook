## 4.1 Types of Contrast Agents

Contrast agents enhance the visibility of structures that would otherwise be difficult to distinguish from surrounding tissue. They work by altering the attenuation of X-rays (iodinated, barium), altering the MRI signal (gadolinium, iron oxide), or reflecting sound waves differently (microbubbles).

### Iodinated Contrast Media (ICM)

Used in: CT, conventional angiography, fluoroscopy, intravenous urography

**Mechanism:** Iodine has a high atomic number (Z=53), strongly absorbing X-rays. Structures containing iodine appear bright (hyperdense) on CT.

#### Classification

**By ionicity:**
| Type | Examples | Osmolality (mOsm/kg) | Relative Risk |
|------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Ionic high-osmolar (HOCM) | Diatrizoate (Gastrografin) | 1400–2100 | Highest |
| Ionic low-osmolar (LOCM) | Ioxaglate (Hexabrix) | ~600 | Moderate |
| Non-ionic low-osmolar (LOCM) | Iohexol, Iopamidol, Iomeprol | 290–860 | Low |
| Non-ionic iso-osmolar (IOCM) | Iodixanol (Visipaque) | 290 | Lowest |

**By route of administration:**
- **Intravascular:** IV for CT angiography, contrast-enhanced CT; intra-arterial for angiography
- **Intrathecal:** Water-soluble non-ionic agents only (e.g., iohexol for myelography)
- **Body cavities:** Diluted non-ionic contrast for joint, biliary, fistula studies
- **Oral/rectal:** For GI opacification in CT (diluted water-soluble or diluted barium)

#### Iodine Concentration

Expressed in mg I/mL:
- Typical IV contrast: 300–370 mg I/mL
- Diluted oral contrast: 2–3 mg I/mL

#### Elimination

- Almost entirely via glomerular filtration (kidneys)
- Half-life ~2 hours in normal renal function
- Prolonged in renal failure — potential toxicity accumulation

---

### Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents (GBCA)

Used in: MRI — virtually all contrast-enhanced MRI studies

**Mechanism:** Gadolinium (Gd³⁺) is a paramagnetic metal. It shortens T1 relaxation time of nearby water protons, resulting in increased (bright) signal on T1-weighted images.

#### Classification

| Type | Structure | Examples | NSF Risk |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Linear ionic | Open chain | Gadopentetate (Magnevist) | Higher |
| Linear non-ionic | Open chain | Gadodiamide (Omniscan) | Higher |
| Macrocyclic ionic | Ring structure | Gadobutrol (Gadavist), Gadoterate (Dotarem) | Lowest |
| Macrocyclic non-ionic | Ring structure | Gadoteridol (ProHance) | Low |

**Macrocyclic agents are more thermodynamically stable** and have lower risk of Gd³⁺ release — preferred in patients with renal impairment.

#### Gadolinium Retention

- GBCAs are known to deposit gadolinium in brain (dentate nucleus, globus pallidus), bone, skin
- Clinical significance of retention is unclear — under investigation
- No evidence of neurological harm from gadolinium retention at current doses
- Use minimum effective dose; avoid unnecessary repeated exposures

---

### Barium Sulfate

Used in: Upper GI series, barium swallow, small bowel follow-through, barium enema

**Mechanism:** Barium has high atomic number, strongly absorbs X-rays. Appears white (radiopaque) on fluoroscopy.

**Advantages:**
- Excellent mucosal coating
- High image contrast
- Inert — not absorbed from GI tract
- Inexpensive

**Key Contraindication:** Suspected bowel perforation or fistula to the mediastinum/peritoneum
- Barium causes severe chemical peritonitis and mediastinitis if it leaks
- Use water-soluble iodinated contrast (e.g., Gastrografin) instead

**Special note on aspiration:**
- Aspiration of barium into lungs causes chemical pneumonitis
- If aspiration risk is high, use non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast instead
- Gastrografin (HOCM) aspiration → severe pulmonary edema; use only if aspiration risk is low

---

### Ultrasound Contrast Agents (Microbubbles)

Used in: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)

**Examples:** SonoVue (sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles), Lumason, Definity (perflutren)

**Mechanism:**
- Microbubbles (1–10 μm diameter) remain within the vascular space
- Oscillate in response to ultrasound pulses
- Enhance echogenicity of blood dramatically
- Allow real-time perfusion imaging without radiation or nephrotoxicity

**Applications:**
- Liver lesion characterization (hepatic phases similar to CT/MRI)
- Assessment of organ vascularity (kidneys, spleen)
- Detection of endoleak after aortic stent grafting
- Cardiac function (echocardiography)

**Safety:** Extremely safe; rare anaphylactoid reactions reported

---

## 4.2 Indications and Contraindications

### Iodinated Contrast Media — Indications

- CT angiography (aorta, pulmonary arteries, carotid arteries, coronary arteries)
- Contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen, chest, pelvis (tumor characterization, infection)
- Conventional angiography and intervention
- Intravenous urography (now largely replaced by CT urography)
- Myelography (water-soluble non-ionic only)
- Arthrography, fistulography

### Iodinated Contrast Media — Contraindications

**Absolute:**
- Previous severe anaphylactoid reaction to same agent (relative — can premedicate)
- Intrathecal use of ionic agents (BANNED — causes fatal neurotoxicity)

**Relative:**
- Previous moderate reaction to iodinated contrast → consider premedication or switch agent
- Significant renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) → risk-benefit assessment; ensure hydration
- Metformin use (see box below)
- Hyperthyroidism (large iodine load can precipitate thyroid storm)
- Myasthenia gravis (ionic agents can worsen)
- Pheochromocytoma (ionic HOCM can trigger hypertensive crisis)
- Sickle cell disease (dehydration risk with HOCM)
- Multiple myeloma (dehydration risk; maintain hydration)

:::caution Metformin and Iodinated Contrast
Metformin + contrast-induced AKI → lactic acidosis (rare but serious).
**Current ACR guidance:**
- eGFR ≥30: no need to withhold metformin for most contrast studies
- eGFR &lt;30 or elective arterial contrast studies: withhold metformin for 48 hours post-procedure
- Check renal function before restarting
:::

### Gadolinium — Indications

- MRI brain, spine, and body with contrast enhancement
- MR angiography
- Identification of blood-brain barrier disruption (tumors, abscess, MS)
- MRI of the heart (cardiac MRI, delayed enhancement for myocardial scar)
- Breast MRI

### Gadolinium — Contraindications

**Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF):**
- Rare but serious condition: fibrosis of skin, joints, and internal organs
- Associated with linear GBCAs in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30)
- Macrocyclic GBCAs: extremely low risk
- **ACR recommendations:**
  - eGFR ≥30: all GBCAs acceptable (with clinical justification)
  - eGFR &lt;30 (not on dialysis): use macrocyclic agents only; avoid linear agents
  - Dialysis patients: macrocyclic agents; dialyze promptly after

**Pregnancy:**
- GBCAs should be used only if absolutely necessary
- Gd crosses the placenta and can persist in amniotic fluid
- FDA Category C; animal studies show some risk
- Breastfeeding: safe — minimal excretion into breast milk

## 4.3 Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Prevention

### Definition

**Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury (CI-AKI):**
- Rise in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥25% increase from baseline within 48 hours of contrast exposure
- Previously called contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)

### True Incidence — Putting Risk in Perspective

Recent studies using appropriate controls show:
- Many cases of "CI-AKI" would have occurred without contrast
- True attributable risk of CI-AKI from modern low-osmolar agents is low
- Estimated true risk (intravenous contrast): 1–2% in patients with CrCl &lt;60 mL/min
- Risk is much higher with intra-arterial administration (direct renal artery injection)

### Risk Factors for CI-AKI

**Patient factors:**
- Pre-existing renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m²) — most important
- Diabetes mellitus with nephropathy
- Dehydration / volume depletion
- Heart failure
- Concurrent nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B)
- Multiple myeloma

**Procedure factors:**
- High volume of contrast agent
- Intra-arterial administration (especially selective renal artery injection)
- Repeat contrast studies within 48 hours
- High-osmolar contrast (ionic agents)

### Prevention Strategies

#### 1. Pre-procedure Hydration (Most Important)

**IV saline:**
- Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) or sodium bicarbonate infusion
- Typical protocol: 1 mL/kg/h for 12 hours before and 12 hours after
- For urgent studies: 3 mL/kg over 1 hour before

**Mechanism:**
- Dilutes contrast in tubules
- Reduces tubular ischemia
- Maintains urine output

#### 2. Minimize Contrast Volume

- Use the minimum volume required for diagnostic quality
- Avoid repeat contrast studies within 48 hours when possible

#### 3. Use Low/Iso-Osmolar Contrast

- Non-ionic LOCM significantly safer than ionic HOCM
- Iso-osmolar IOCM (iodixanol) — may provide additional benefit in high-risk patients
- Now standard of care to use LOCM/IOCM

#### 4. Withhold Nephrotoxic Drugs

- Hold NSAIDs 24–48 hours before contrast
- Hold metformin (see above)
- Review all nephrotoxic medications

#### 5. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

- Antioxidant
- Was widely used but evidence is inconsistent
- Some guidelines no longer recommend routinely; others still include it
- If used: 600–1200 mg orally twice daily the day before and day of contrast

#### 6. Post-Procedure Monitoring

- Check serum creatinine at 48–72 hours in high-risk patients
- Ensure adequate ongoing hydration
- Hold nephrotoxic drugs until renal function recovers

### What NOT to Do

- Do not withhold clinically indicated contrast studies due to fear of CI-AKI alone
- Failure to diagnose a life-threatening condition (PE, aortic dissection) is far more dangerous
- Risk of CI-AKI must be weighed against risk of incorrect/delayed diagnosis

## 4.4 Allergic Reactions and Management

### Classification of Contrast Reactions

Reactions to iodinated contrast are **not true IgE-mediated allergies** for the most part — they are **anaphylactoid (pseudoallergic) reactions** that mimic anaphylaxis but do not require prior sensitization.

#### Severity Classification

**Mild reactions (90% of all reactions):**
- Nausea, vomiting
- Warmth, flushing
- Itching, urticaria
- Sneezing, mild rhinorrhea
- Management: Observation; antihistamine if symptoms persist

**Moderate reactions:**
- Diffuse urticaria, angioedema
- Bronchospasm
- Tachycardia or bradycardia
- Management: Active treatment required; IV diphenhydramine, bronchodilators

**Severe/Life-threatening reactions:**
- Severe bronchospasm, laryngeal edema
- Hypotension, cardiovascular collapse
- Loss of consciousness
- Seizures
- Management: Epinephrine, resuscitation, emergency team

### Overall Incidence

- Non-ionic LOCM: ~0.5–1% mild reactions; ~0.04% moderate; ~0.004% severe
- Fatality: ~1 in 170,000 injections
- Previously allergic patient: 3–5x increased risk

### Risk Factors

- Previous contrast reaction (most important risk factor)
- Atopy (asthma, hay fever, eczema) — 2–3x increased risk
- Note: Shellfish allergy is NOT a specific risk factor (outdated concept); shellfish allergy ≠ iodine allergy
- Anxiety does not independently increase reaction risk

### Management of Acute Reactions

:::danger Anaphylactic Reaction — Emergency Protocol
1. **Epinephrine** (adrenaline) — first-line treatment
   - Adult: 0.5 mg IM (0.5 mL of 1:1000) into lateral thigh
   - Repeat every 5 minutes as needed
2. Call for help / activate emergency response
3. Position: Supine with legs elevated (if no respiratory distress)
4. IV access — rapid saline bolus
5. High-flow oxygen
6. Consider: Antihistamines (secondary), corticosteroids (secondary)
7. Monitor ECG, BP, SpO2
8. Transfer to emergency department
:::

**Mild urticaria only:**
- Diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV/IM
- Observe for 20–30 minutes
- May discharge if stable

**Bronchospasm:**
- Inhaled beta-2 agonist (salbutamol)
- If severe: epinephrine

**Hypotension:**
- IV fluid bolus
- Epinephrine if unresponsive to fluids
- Treat as anaphylaxis if epinephrine required

### Premedication Regimens

Used for patients with prior moderate/severe contrast reactions:

**Standard premedication:**
- Prednisolone 50 mg PO at 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before contrast
- PLUS Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM/PO 1 hour before contrast

**Accelerated premedication (urgent studies):**
- Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV q4h × 2 doses before contrast
- PLUS Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 1 hour before

**Note:** Premedication reduces but does not eliminate risk of repeat reaction

## 4.5 Patient Preparation for Contrast Studies

### General Preparation

**Informed consent:**
- Explain risks, benefits, and alternatives
- Document discussion
- For gadolinium: mention gadolinium retention (uncertain clinical significance)

**Baseline laboratory tests:**
- Serum creatinine/eGFR: required before IV iodinated contrast in patients at risk
- ACR criteria for obtaining baseline renal function before contrast:
  - Age ≥60, diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, known single kidney, multiple myeloma, metformin use

**Hydration:**
- Encourage oral fluid intake prior to elective contrast studies
- IV hydration protocol for high-risk patients

### Fasting Requirements

| Study | Fasting Requirement |
|-------|---------------------|
| IV iodinated contrast (CT) | None required for IV contrast alone |
| Barium upper GI series | NPO for 6–8 hours |
| Barium enema | Bowel preparation (laxatives) |
| Gadolinium IV | None |
| Nuclear medicine studies | Variable by protocol |

**Note:** Fasting reduces nausea from contrast but is not strictly required for IV contrast studies in most patients. Follow institutional protocols.

### Intravenous Access

- 18–22 gauge IV catheter for most CT contrast injections
- Power injectors require power-injectable catheters (check port compatibility)
- Antecubital fossa preferred
- Avoid injecting through PICC lines with standard power injectors

### IV Contrast Flow Rates

| Examination | Typical Flow Rate |
|-------------|------------------|
| CT Chest | 3–4 mL/s |
| CT Abdomen/Pelvis | 2–3 mL/s |
| CT Pulmonary Angiography | 4–5 mL/s |
| CT Coronary Angiography | 5–6 mL/s |

### Special Populations

**Thyroid disease:**
- Large iodine load (contrast) can trigger thyroid storm in hyperthyroid patients
- Screen for hyperthyroidism if clinically suspected
- Elective use: optimize thyroid status first

**Pheochromocytoma:**
- Ionic contrast can trigger hypertensive crisis
- Use non-ionic LOCM; ensure adequate alpha-blockade before any contrast

**Myasthenia gravis:**
- Ionic contrast may worsen neuromuscular blockade
- Use non-ionic LOCM

**Dialysis patients:**
- iodinated contrast: proceed with routine dialysis after (not emergency dialysis)
- Gadolinium: use macrocyclic agent; dialyze promptly after

## Key Points Summary

1. **Four main contrast types:** Iodinated (CT/fluoroscopy), gadolinium (MRI), barium (GI fluoroscopy), microbubbles (ultrasound)

2. **Non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast** is standard for IV use; significantly safer than ionic agents

3. **Gadolinium safety:** Macrocyclic agents are safer in renal failure; linear agents associated with higher NSF risk

4. **Barium is contraindicated** if bowel perforation suspected — use water-soluble contrast instead

5. **CI-AKI risk** is real but often overestimated; adequate hydration and minimizing contrast volume are key preventive measures

6. **Contrast reactions are anaphylactoid** (not true allergy); epinephrine is first-line treatment for severe reactions

7. **Premedication** with steroids + antihistamine reduces but does not eliminate risk of repeat reaction

8. **Shellfish allergy** does NOT specifically increase contrast reaction risk
