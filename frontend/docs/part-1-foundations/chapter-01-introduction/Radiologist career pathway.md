# Radiologist Career Pathway

Radiologists are physicians who specialize in interpreting medical images to guide patient care. The field encompasses both diagnostic radiology, which focuses on detecting disease, and interventional radiology, which involves minimally invasive procedures guided by imaging.

## Physician Training Pathway

### Medical School and Residency
- Complete 4 years of medical school
- Enter a diagnostic radiology residency program (typically 4-5 years)
- Participate in preliminary year (internship) - often surgery, internal medicine, or transitional year
- Complete American Board of Radiology (ABR) certification examinations

### Fellowship Specialization
After residency, radiologists may pursue fellowships in subspecialties:
- **Interventional Radiology**: 2-year fellowship focusing on minimally invasive procedures
- **Neuroradiology**: Brain, spine, and head/neck imaging
- **Musculoskeletal Radiology**: Bones, joints, and soft tissue imaging
- **Body Imaging**: Abdominal and pelvic imaging
- **Thoracic Radiology**: Chest imaging including cardiac imaging
- **Pediatric Radiology**: Imaging of infants, children, and adolescents
- **Nuclear Medicine**: Functional imaging with radiopharmaceuticals
- **Breast Imaging**: Mammography, breast ultrasound, and breast MRI

## Academic and Research Careers

### Academic Radiologist
- Combine clinical practice with teaching responsibilities
- Conduct research in imaging technology or clinical applications
