## 5.1 ACR Appropriateness Criteria

### Background and Purpose

The **American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria** are evidence-based guidelines developed to help clinicians order the most appropriate imaging study for a given clinical condition. They were first developed in 1993 and are regularly updated based on new evidence.

**Goals:**
- Improve quality of care by matching the clinical question to the best imaging modality
- Reduce inappropriate imaging (both over- and under-utilization)
- Reduce unnecessary radiation exposure
- Improve cost-effectiveness in healthcare

### Structure of the ACR Criteria

**Organization:**
- Divided into clinical topics (e.g., "Acute Chest Pain — Suspected Pulmonary Embolism")
- Each topic has a panel of radiologists and clinicians who review evidence
- Each variant (clinical scenario) is assigned a **Rating** for each imaging modality

**Rating Scale:**

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 7–9 | **Usually Appropriate** — expected benefits exceed risks substantially |
| 4–6 | **May Be Appropriate** — benefit/risk varies; clinical judgment required |
| 1–3 | **Usually Not Appropriate** — risk likely exceeds benefit |

**Radiation categories** assigned to each procedure:
- O = no radiation (ultrasound, MRI)
- A = minimal (&lt;1 mSv)
- B = low (1–5 mSv)
- C = medium (5–10 mSv)
- D = high (&gt;10 mSv)

### How to Use the ACR Criteria

1. Identify the clinical condition/variant
2. Look up the topic in ACR AC (available free at acsearch.acr.org)
3. Review ratings for each imaging modality
4. Select the most appropriate study considering patient-specific factors

### Examples of ACR Criteria Application

**Scenario 1: Suspected Pulmonary Embolism**
- CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA): Usually Appropriate (Rating 9)
- V/Q scan: Usually Appropriate in certain circumstances (Rating 8)
- Chest X-ray: May be appropriate (helpful to exclude mimics)
- D-dimer should guide clinical pre-test probability

**Scenario 2: Low Back Pain — No Red Flags, &lt;6 Weeks**
- X-ray lumbar spine: Usually NOT Appropriate (Rating 2) — 98% of cases resolve without imaging
- MRI lumbar spine: Usually NOT Appropriate (Rating 2) — early MRI does not change outcomes
- Note: Red flags (fever, weight loss, history of cancer, bladder dysfunction) change the appropriateness

**Scenario 3: Right Lower Quadrant Pain — Suspected Appendicitis**
- Adult: CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast: Usually Appropriate (Rating 9)
- Pediatric (under 12): US first; CT only if US equivocal — to reduce radiation
- Pregnant: Ultrasound first, then MRI; CT only if others unavailable

## 5.2 Choosing the Right Imaging Modality

### Modality Characteristics

| Modality | Best For | Limitations |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **X-ray** | Bone, chest, foreign bodies | Limited soft tissue contrast |
| **CT** | Rapid survey, bone detail, lung, vascular | Radiation, contrast risks |
| **MRI** | Soft tissue, brain, spine, joints | Time, cost, claustrophobia, implants |
| **Ultrasound** | Liver, gallbladder, obstetrics, vascular | Operator-dependent, gas/bone limits |
| **Nuclear Medicine** | Functional imaging, bone scan, thyroid | Radiation, limited anatomy |
| **PET-CT** | Oncology staging, metabolic activity | Cost, radiation, limited availability |

### Clinical Scenarios and Preferred Modalities

#### Neurological

| Condition | First Choice | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Acute stroke | CT non-contrast | Rapid, rules out hemorrhage |
| Brain tumor | MRI with contrast | Superior soft tissue detail |
| Head trauma | CT non-contrast | Rapid, detects acute hemorrhage |

| Aortic aneurysm sizing/planning | CTA | |
| Deep vein thrombosis | Ultrasound | |

### Clinical Decision-Making Framework

When selecting an imaging study, consider:

1. **Clinical question:** What specific anatomical or functional information is needed?
2. **Sensitivity and specificity:** Will this test reliably answer the question?
3. **Availability:** Is the modality available in the clinical setting (ED vs. outpatient)?
4. **Speed:** Is this an emergency requiring rapid results?
5. **Radiation:** Can a non-ionizing modality answer the question equally well?
6. **Cost:** Is the more expensive test justified?
7. **Patient factors:** Renal function (contrast), metal implants (MRI), pregnancy, claustrophobia
8. **Pre-test probability:** Does imaging change clinical management?

## 5.3 Cost-Effectiveness in Imaging

### Understanding Healthcare Costs

**Direct costs of imaging:**
- Equipment acquisition and maintenance
- Personnel (radiologist, technologist, nurses)
- Contrast materials
- Patient time (indirect cost)

**Typical cost ranges (US, approximate):**

| Modality | Approximate Cost |
|----------|-----------------|
| Chest X-ray | $50–$200 |
| Abdominal X-ray | $100–$300 |
| CT Head | $500–$2,000 |
| CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis | $2,000–$5,000 |
| MRI Brain | $1,500–$4,000 |
| MRI Spine | $1,500–$4,000 |
| Ultrasound Abdomen | $200–$1,000 |
| PET-CT | $4,000–$8,000 |

### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

**Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY):**
- Standard threshold for cost-effectiveness: &lt;$50,000–$100,000/QALY (varies by country)
- Imaging that detects early, treatable disease can be highly cost-effective

**Key cost-effectiveness principles:**

1. **Use the right test the first time** — ordering multiple sequential tests wastes resources
2. **Avoid tests that won't change management** — imaging findings should influence treatment decisions
3. **Apply clinical pre-test probability** — imaging is least cost-effective when pre-test probability is very low or very high
4. **Use algorithms** — structured pathways reduce unnecessary imaging (e.g., Wells score + D-dimer before CTPA)

### Economic Considerations in CT Screening

**Lung Cancer Screening CT:**
- Low-dose CT (LDCT) in high-risk patients (heavy smokers, 50–80 years)
- Reduces lung cancer mortality by 20–24% (NLST and NELSON trials)
- Cost-effective when appropriately targeted

**Colon Cancer Screening:**
- CT Colonography (virtual colonoscopy) — cost-effective alternative to optical colonoscopy
- Requires colonoscopy for any polyp found (additional cost if positive)

**Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Scoring:**
- CT without contrast to detect coronary calcification
- Risk stratification for cardiovascular disease
- Cost-effective in intermediate-risk patients for guiding statin therapy

### Downstream Costs

Imaging can create **downstream costs** through:
- **Incidentalomas:** Incidentally discovered findings requiring follow-up (pulmonary nodules, adrenal adenomas, thyroid nodules)
- **False positives:** Unnecessary biopsies, additional imaging, patient anxiety
- **Over-diagnosis:** Detecting conditions that would never have caused symptoms (e.g., indolent prostate cancer on MRI)

Structured reporting and management guidelines (e.g., Fleischner Society guidelines for pulmonary nodules, TI-RADS for thyroid nodules) help manage incidentalomas cost-effectively.

## 5.4 Avoiding Unnecessary Radiation Exposure

### The Problem of Inappropriate CT Use

CT is the largest single source of medical radiation exposure in the US, accounting for ~48% of collective dose from medical radiation. Rising CT utilization has led to concerns about population-level cancer risk.

**Estimates (controversial but widely cited):**
- ~1.5–2% of all cancers in the US may be attributable to CT radiation
- One CT abdomen/pelvis ≈ 3.3 years background radiation equivalent
- Risk is highest in children (longer life expectancy, more radiosensitive)

### Identifying Inappropriate Imaging

**Red flags for potentially unnecessary imaging:**
- Repeating a study within 24–48 hours without clinical change
- Ordering CT when ultrasound can answer the same question (particularly in young women and children)
- Imaging low back pain without red flags within first 6 weeks
- Ordering brain CT for uncomplicated headache without red flags
- Follow-up CT for small pulmonary nodules in low-risk patients not following Fleischner guidelines
- "Routine" pre-operative chest X-ray in young, healthy patients

### Clinical Decision Support Integration

**Electronic Clinical Decision Support (CDS):**
- Software embedded in the Electronic Health Record (EHR)
- Alerts clinicians when ordering "usually not appropriate" studies
- Required by law for advanced imaging in Medicare (PAMA, US 2020)
- Studies show 15–30% reduction in inappropriate imaging with CDS implementation

**How CDS works:**
1. Clinician enters clinical indication
2. CDS cross-references ACR Appropriateness Criteria
3. System displays appropriateness rating for ordered study
4. Clinician can override with documentation
5. Data tracked for quality improvement

### Radiation Reduction Strategies

**For clinicians ordering imaging:**
- Ask: "Will this test change my management?"
- Consider: "Can US or MRI answer this question?"
- Apply clinical decision rules before ordering (Ottawa Ankle Rules, Wells score, NEXUS criteria)
- Avoid repeating recent imaging without clinical justification
- Review prior imaging before ordering new studies

**For radiologists:**
- Optimize protocols for minimum dose consistent with diagnostic quality
- Use iterative reconstruction in CT (50% dose reduction vs. filtered back projection)
- Apply dose modulation (lower dose to less dense body parts)
- Avoid unnecessary additional phases in CT (each phase doubles dose)

---

## 5.5 Clinical Decision Support Tools

### Validated Clinical Decision Rules

These evidence-based rules reduce unnecessary imaging:

#### Ottawa Ankle/Foot Rules
**Question:** Does this patient need an ankle or foot X-ray?

**Ankle X-ray required if ANY of:**
- Bone tenderness at posterior 6 cm of fibula or tip of lateral malleolus
- Bone tenderness at posterior 6 cm of tibia or tip of medial malleolus
- Inability to bear weight immediately and in the ED (4 steps)

**Foot X-ray required if:**
- Bone tenderness at base of 5th metatarsal
- Bone tenderness at navicular
- Inability to bear weight

**Performance:** Sensitivity ~99% for fracture; reduces X-rays by 30–40%

#### Ottawa Knee Rules
X-ray needed only if:
- Age ≥55
- Tenderness at fibular head
- Isolated patella tenderness (no other bone tenderness)
- Inability to flex to 90°
- Inability to bear weight

#### NEXUS Criteria (Cervical Spine Imaging)
**C-spine imaging NOT required if ALL criteria met:**
- No posterior midline cervical tenderness
- No focal neurological deficit
- Normal alertness
- No intoxication
- No distracting injury

**Canadian C-Spine Rule** — more specific in certain populations

#### Wells Score for DVT and PE

**DVT Wells Score:** Estimates pre-test probability; guides use of D-dimer and Doppler ultrasound

**PE Wells Score:**
- Low probability (score &lt;2): D-dimer; if negative, no CTPA needed
- Moderate probability: D-dimer; if elevated, CTPA
- High probability (score &gt;6): Direct CTPA

#### HEART Score (Chest Pain in ED)
Guides whether to image for ACS:
- History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin
- Low HEART score: safe discharge without advanced imaging
- High HEART score: early cardiology referral ± coronary imaging

#### Revised Geneva Score (Pulmonary Embolism)

### Structured Reporting Systems

Standardized reporting systems help manage incidental findings:

| System | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **BI-RADS** | Breast imaging assessment (0–6 scale) |
| **PIRADS** | Prostate MRI assessment |
| **LI-RADS** | Liver lesion assessment (at-risk patients) |
| **Lung-RADS** | Lung cancer screening CT |
| **TI-RADS** | Thyroid nodule ultrasound |
| **O-RADS** | Ovarian lesion assessment |
| **NI-RADS** | Head/neck cancer surveillance |

**Purpose:** Standardize reporting, communicate risk level, guide management, enable quality tracking

### The "Right Test, Right Patient, Right Time" Framework

Modern radiology stewardship aims to ensure:
- **Right test:** Most appropriate modality for the clinical question
- **Right patient:** Imaging in patients who will benefit (appropriate pre-test probability)
- **Right time:** Timely imaging that influences management
- **Right indication:** Documented clinical justification
- **Right preparation:** Proper patient preparation to maximize diagnostic yield

## Key Points Summary

1. **ACR Appropriateness Criteria** provide evidence-based ratings (1–9) for imaging appropriateness in specific clinical scenarios

2. **Modality selection** should match the clinical question, considering radiation, cost, availability, and patient factors

3. **Pre-test probability** is crucial — imaging is most valuable when pre-test probability is intermediate

4. **Clinical decision rules** (Ottawa Rules, Wells Score, NEXUS) reduce unnecessary imaging while maintaining diagnostic accuracy

5. **CT is the major source** of medical radiation exposure; avoiding inappropriate CT is a major quality improvement goal

6. **Clinical decision support** software embedded in EHR reduces inappropriate imaging by 15–30%

7. **Incidentalomas** create downstream costs; structured reporting systems (BI-RADS, LI-RADS) provide management guidance
