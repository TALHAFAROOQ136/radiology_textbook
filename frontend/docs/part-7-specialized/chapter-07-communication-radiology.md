## 54.1 The Radiology Report

### Structure of a Standard Radiology Report

A well-structured radiology report is the primary means of communication between radiologists and referring clinicians.

**Standard report components:**

**1. Header / Study Information**
- Patient demographics (name, DOB, ID)
- Examination type (e.g., CT Chest with contrast)
- Date of study
- Clinical indication / referring physician
- Comparison studies

**2. Technique**
- Modality-specific details
- Contrast agent used (type, volume, route)
- CT: Dose information (CTDIvol, DLP), phase of acquisition
- MRI: Field strength, sequences performed
- Nuclear Medicine: Radiopharmaceutical, dose, timing

**3. Findings**
- Systematic description of all relevant findings
- Normal structures should also be commented on (where appropriate)
- Organized anatomically or by system
- Use precise anatomic terminology
- Describe: location, size, morphology, signal/density characteristics, change from prior

**4. Impression (Conclusion)**
- Concise interpretation of key findings
- Differential diagnosis (numbered, most likely first)
- Clinical significance of findings
- Recommendations for further workup

**5. Signature**
- Radiologist name, qualifications
- Date and time of report

## 54.2 Report Writing Principles

### Clarity and Precision

**Good radiology reports:**
- Written for the clinical audience (primary care, specialist, emergency physician)
- Avoid unexplained jargon without clinical context
- Quantify where possible (size in mm/cm, not "large/small")
- Use comparative language when prior studies available

**Common pitfalls:**
- Vague terms: "cannot exclude," "possible," "may represent" — use sparingly
- Hedging without recommendation — leaves clinician without guidance
- Missing incidental findings of clinical relevance
- Report that is too long — key findings buried

### Structured Reporting

**Benefits of structured/template reports:**
- Improves completeness
- Facilitates data extraction
- Reduces variability between radiologists
- Enhances referring physician satisfaction

**Examples:** ACR standardized templates; LI-RADS (liver); Lung-RADS; BI-RADS; PI-RADS (prostate)

### Impression Section

**The Impression is the most important part of the report.**

**Principles:**
- Lead with the most significant finding
- Number each conclusion
- Each numbered item should be actionable
- Include clinical context ("in a patient with known lymphoma, this likely represents...")
- Recommend next steps explicitly

**Example of poor impression:**
> "Multiple pulmonary nodules are seen."

**Example of good impression:**
> "1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, largest 8 mm in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pulmonary metastases in the context of known colorectal carcinoma. CT-guided biopsy or PET-CT staging recommended for further characterization."

## 54.3 Critical Results Communication

### What Constitutes a Critical (Urgent) Finding?

**ACR definition:** A finding that may be life-threatening or require urgent management and that the ordering physician may not be aware of.

**Examples of critical findings:**
- Acute intracranial hemorrhage
- Tension pneumothorax / large pneumothorax
- Aortic dissection / rupture
- Pulmonary embolism (large / saddle PE)
- Acute bowel ischemia / perforation
- Pneumoperitoneum (free air)
- Acute spinal cord compression
- Unexpected malignancy in acute setting

### Communication Protocol

**Critical finding communication process:**
1. Radiologist identifies critical finding
2. **Direct telephone contact** with ordering clinician (not just written report)
3. Verbal communication of finding; confirm understanding ("read-back")
4. Document in report: date, time, person contacted, content of communication
5. If clinician unavailable: Escalate to on-call physician or senior colleague

**ACR recommendation:** Critical results should be communicated within **60 minutes** of identification.

### Documentation

**The report must document:**
- Time of radiologist identification
- Time of communication
- Person contacted (name and role)
- Method of communication (telephone)

**Medico-legal importance:** Documentation protects the radiologist in cases of delayed treatment.

## 54.4 Radiologist-Clinician Communication

### Consultative Role of Radiology

**Modern radiology is consultative:**
- Radiologist as consultant, not just film reader
- Active participation in multidisciplinary team meetings (MDT)
- Direct consultation before and after imaging

### Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Meetings

**Radiologist's role in MDT:**
- Presenting imaging findings in clinical context
- Characterizing tumor stage, resectability
- Identifying complications of treatment
- Recommending next imaging steps

**Common MDT contexts:**
- Oncology MDT (cancer staging and treatment)
- Trauma MDT (injury characterization)
- Neurology/Neurosurgery (stroke, tumor)

### Communication with Patients

**Direct radiologist-patient communication is increasing:**
- Radiology results increasingly shared directly with patients (online portals)
- Patients may contact radiology about their results
- Opportunity for patient education

**Best practices:**
- Ensure patient understands incidental findings are common
- Direct complex communication to referring clinician
- Written language in reports should be understandable to non-clinicians (plain English where possible)

---

## 54.5 Incidental Findings

### Managing Incidental Findings

**Incidental findings:** Findings unrelated to the original indication, discovered during imaging.

**Examples:**
- Pulmonary nodule on chest CT ordered for PE
- Renal mass on abdominal CT for appendicitis
- Adrenal adenoma on chest CT
- Adnexal cyst on CT abdomen/pelvis

### Reporting Responsibilities

**Radiologist must:**
- Report all clinically significant incidental findings
- Provide management recommendations based on evidence-based guidelines
- Use standardized classification systems where available

**Key guidelines for incidental findings:**

| Finding | Guideline |
|---------|----------|
| Pulmonary nodule | Fleischner Society guidelines |
| Liver lesion | LI-RADS (if cirrhosis), ACR guidance |
| Adrenal mass | ACR white paper on adrenal incidentaloma |
| Renal mass | Bosniak classification (cysts); follow-up recommendations |
| Thyroid nodule | ACR TI-RADS; TIRADS classification |

### "Don't Miss" Incidental Findings

**High-priority incidentals:**
- Aortic aneurysm (>3 cm — new finding requires communication)
- Lung nodule meeting Fleischner criteria for biopsy
- Unexpected malignancy (lymphadenopathy, mass)
- Vertebral fracture (osteoporosis, malignancy)

## 54.6 Medico-Legal Aspects

### Radiological Negligence

**Elements of negligence:**
1. Duty of care (existed between radiologist and patient)
2. Breach of duty (fell below standard of care)
3. Causation (breach caused harm)
4. Damages (patient suffered harm)

### Common Medico-Legal Issues in Radiology

**Missed findings:**
- Retrospective analysis of prior studies showing overlooked lesion
- "Satisfaction of search" error: Finding one abnormality and stopping
- Systematic review of entire image set required

**Miscommunication:**
- Failure to communicate critical finding promptly
- Report not read by clinician — radiologist's report delivered, responsibility shared

**Technical errors:**
- Wrong patient or wrong side
- Incorrect protocol leading to non-diagnostic study
- Image labeling errors

### Risk Reduction Strategies

- Systematic search pattern for every study
- Comparison with prior imaging always performed
- Use of standardized lexicons (BI-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS)
- Documented critical result communication
- Double reading for high-stakes studies (mammography AI-assist)
- Peer review and case conference (learning from errors)

## Key Points Summary

1. **The Impression** is the most important part of the report — lead with the most significant finding, number conclusions, include recommendations

2. **Critical findings** require direct telephone communication within 60 minutes; document name, time, and content of communication

3. **MDT participation** — radiologist provides essential staging and treatment-planning information

4. **Incidental findings** — must be reported with appropriate management recommendations based on evidence-based guidelines (Fleischner, Bosniak, ACR TI-RADS)

5. **Satisfaction of search** — major source of missed findings; complete systematic review of entire study required

6. **Documentation** of critical result communication is essential for medico-legal protection
