# Chapter 53: Breast Imaging

## Learning Objectives

- Describe mammography technique and interpretation
- Apply BI-RADS classification system
- Identify benign vs. malignant mammographic features
- Describe ultrasound evaluation of breast lesions
- Know indications for breast MRI

---

## 53.1 Mammography

### Technique

**Standard mammographic views:**
- Craniocaudal (CC): Compression from above; breast spread
- Mediolateral Oblique (MLO): Most important view; includes axillary tail
- Additional views: Spot compression, magnification, lateral

**Digital Mammography:**
- Standard digital full-field mammography (FFDM)
- Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT/3D mammography): Multiple low-dose projections → 3D reconstruction
  - Better for dense breasts
  - Reduces "summation" artifact (overlapping tissue)

### Breast Density (BI-RADS Density Categories)

| Category | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| A — Almost entirely fatty | &lt;25% fibroglandular | Best sensitivity |
| B — Scattered fibroglandular | 25-50% | Good sensitivity |
| C — Heterogeneously dense | 51-75% dense | Reduced sensitivity |
| D — Extremely dense | >75% dense | Significantly reduced sensitivity; masking effect |

**Dense breasts:** Supplemental screening (ultrasound or MRI) may be recommended

### Screening Mammography

**Recommendations (ACS 2015):**
- Annual mammography: Starting age 45 (or 40 with shared decision-making)
- Biennial option: Age 55+

**High-risk screening:**
- Annual MRI + mammography for women with >20% lifetime risk
- BRCA1/2 carriers, strong family history

## 53.2 BI-RADS Classification

### ACR BI-RADS Categories

| Category | Assessment | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **0** | Incomplete | Additional imaging needed |
| **1** | Negative | Routine screening |
| **2** | Benign | Routine screening |
| **3** | Probably benign | Short-interval follow-up (6 months) |
| **4** | Suspicious | Biopsy recommended |
| **4A** | Low suspicion | Biopsy; low malignancy risk |
| **4B** | Intermediate suspicion | Biopsy |
| **4C** | Moderate-high suspicion | Biopsy; high concern |
| **5** | Highly suggestive of malignancy | Biopsy |
| **6** | Known biopsy-proven malignancy | Treatment planning |

### Mammographic Features

**Mass descriptors:**

| Feature | Benign | Malignant |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Shape** | Round, oval | Irregular |
| **Margins** | Circumscribed | Spiculated, indistinct, microlobulated |
| **Density** | Low, equal | High density |
| **Calcifications** | — | Pleomorphic, fine linear |

### Calcifications

**Benign calcifications:**
- Vascular: Tramtrack; arterial walls
- Skin: Lucent center; dermal location
- Popcorn: Involuting fibroadenoma
- Milk of calcium: Layering on lateral view; sedimentation
- Eggshell/rim: Fat necrosis, oil cyst
- Large rod-like: Secretory calcifications; ductal

**Suspicious calcifications (biopsy warranted):**
- **Pleomorphic:** Variable shape and size; irregular
- **Fine linear/linear branching:** Filling ducts; DCIS pattern
- **Amorphous:** Indistinct; lower suspicion than pleomorphic

## 53.3 Breast Lesion Characteristics

### Benign Entities

**Fibroadenoma:**
- Most common benign breast tumor; young women
- Well-circumscribed, oval, low-density mass
- Popcorn calcification (involuting)
- Ultrasound: Oval, circumscribed, homogeneous, parallel orientation
- BI-RADS 2-3

**Simple Cyst:**
- Round, circumscribed, low density on mammogram
- Ultrasound: Anechoic, circumscribed, posterior acoustic enhancement
- BI-RADS 2 (benign if simple); aspiration only if symptomatic

**Fat Necrosis:**
- History of trauma/surgery/radiation
- Lucent (fatty) lesion with rim calcification
- Oil cyst on mammogram
- BI-RADS 2

**Lymph Node (normal):**
- Reniform; fatty hilum; circumscribed
- Axillary or intramammary

### Malignant Features

**Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) — Most common:**
- Spiculated mass with dense center
- Associated calcifications
- Skin thickening, nipple retraction (advanced)

**Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC):**
- Infiltrative; architecturally distorting
- Single file cells; may appear as asymmetry only
- Difficult to detect on mammogram and US

**Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS):**
- Non-invasive; confined to ducts
- Presents as suspicious calcifications (fine linear, pleomorphic)
- Treatment: Lumpectomy ± radiation; mastectomy for extensive DCIS

**Inflammatory Breast Cancer:**
- Skin thickening, erythema, peau d'orange
- Not a mass; lymphatic invasion of dermis
- Urgent biopsy

## 53.4 Breast Ultrasound

### Role of Breast Ultrasound

**Primary indications:**
- Evaluate palpable mass (especially &lt;30 years)
- Differentiate cyst from solid mass
- Characterize mammographic abnormality
- Image-guided biopsy guidance
- Supplemental screening in dense breasts

### US Features

**Benign features:**
- Anechoic (cyst)
- Oval or round shape
- Circumscribed margins
- Parallel orientation (wider-than-tall)
- Homogeneous internal echotexture
- Posterior acoustic enhancement (cyst)

**Malignant features:**
- Irregular shape
- Angular, microlobulated, or indistinct margins
- Non-parallel orientation (taller-than-wide)
- Posterior acoustic shadowing (desmoplastic reaction)
- Heterogeneous internal echoes
- Skin thickening, lymphadenopathy

**Axillary lymph node:**
- Metastatic: Cortical thickening (>3 mm), eccentric cortex, lost hilum
- Normal: Reniform, thin cortex, echogenic hilum

---

## 53.5 Breast MRI

### Technique

- **Protocol:** Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI
- Bilateral; prone position; breast coils
- Acquisitions: Pre-contrast + multiple post-contrast phases

**Kinetic enhancement curves:**
- Type I (persistent): Benign
- Type II (plateau): Indeterminate
- Type III (washout): Suspicious for malignancy

### Indications for Breast MRI

| Indication | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| High-risk screening (>20% lifetime) | Supplemental sensitivity |
| BRCA carriers | Annual MRI |
| Extent of disease assessment (newly diagnosed) | Detect additional foci |
| Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy | Monitor treatment |
| Implant evaluation | Rupture assessment |
| Occult primary breast cancer | Axillary metastasis; normal mammogram |
| Post-conservation margins | Residual disease |

### MRI BI-RADS Features

**Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE):**
- Minimal, mild, moderate, marked
- High BPE: Reduces specificity; may vary with menstrual cycle

**Mass enhancement features:**
- Shape, margin, internal enhancement (homogeneous, heterogeneous, rim enhancement)

**Non-mass enhancement:**
- Linear, segmental (DCIS), regional, diffuse patterns

## 53.6 Image-Guided Biopsy

### Biopsy Methods

| Method | Guidance | Yield |
|--------|---------|-------|
| US-guided core biopsy | Ultrasound | First choice if visible on US |
| Stereotactic biopsy | Mammography | Calcifications; not visible on US |
| MRI-guided biopsy | MRI | Only seen on MRI |
| Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) | US or palpation | Cytology only; lower sensitivity |

**Core biopsy preferred over FNA:**
- Provides histology (not just cytology)
- Can diagnose invasion vs. in situ
- Marker clip placed at biopsy site

### Post-Biopsy

**Clip marker:** Placed at biopsy site to:
- Localize site for surgery if malignant
- Document sampled area on follow-up imaging

**Wire localization or seed localization:**
- Non-palpable lesions requiring surgical excision
- Wire placed under image guidance the morning of surgery

## Key Points Summary

1. **BI-RADS 3** — Probably benign; 6-month follow-up (NOT biopsy); &lt;2% malignancy

2. **Spiculated mass** — Most suspicious mammographic feature; associated with IDC

3. **Pleomorphic/fine linear calcifications** — Suspicious; biopsy; DCIS pattern

4. **Fibroadenoma** — Circumscribed oval mass; parallel US orientation; BI-RADS 2-3; popcorn calcification when involuting

5. **Breast MRI:** Washout kinetic pattern = suspicious; used for high-risk screening, extent of disease

6. **US-guided core biopsy** — First choice for sonographically visible lesions; stereotactic for mammography-only findings
