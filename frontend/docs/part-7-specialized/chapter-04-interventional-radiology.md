## 51.1 Principles of Interventional Radiology

### Image Guidance Modalities

| Modality | Best For | Considerations |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Fluoroscopy | Vascular procedures; real-time guidance | Radiation; iodinated contrast |
| Ultrasound | Superficial biopsy/drainage; vascular access | No radiation; real-time; limited depth |
| CT | Deep lesions; lung biopsy; drainage | Excellent anatomic detail; radiation |
| MRI | Soft tissue discrimination; prostate | Limited by equipment; slower |

### Pre-procedure Assessment

**Coagulation:**
- INR: Typically &lt;1.5 for major procedures
- Platelets: Typically >50,000/μL for most procedures
- Anticoagulation management: Hold warfarin 5 days, bridge if needed

**Renal function:**
- eGFR for contrast-enhanced procedures
- Hydration protocol for borderline renal function

**Patient preparation:**
- Informed consent
- IV access
- NPO status for sedated procedures
- Relevant imaging review

## 51.2 Vascular Access

### Central Venous Access

**Types of central venous catheters:**

| Type | Site | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) | Basilic/cephalic v. → SVC | Long-term IV therapy |
| Tunneled catheter (Hickman) | Internal jugular/subclavian → SVC | Chemotherapy; long-term |
| Port (implanted) | Subcutaneous; tip in SVC | Long-term; less infection risk |
| Dialysis catheter | Internal jugular | Hemodialysis |

**Tip position:** Distal SVC / cavoatrial junction (confirmed on CXR)

**Complications:**
- Pneumothorax (subclavian approach higher risk)
- Hemothorax, arterial puncture
- Catheter malposition
- Infection, venous thrombosis

### Arterial Access

**Common sites:**
- Common femoral artery: Most common; compressible
- Radial artery: Preferred for coronary access; lower bleeding
- Brachial, axillary: When femoral not available

**Closure devices:** Angioseal, Perclose; vs. manual compression

## 51.3 Angiography and Vascular Intervention

### Diagnostic Angiography

**Principles:**
- Seldinger technique: Needle → wire → catheter
- Contrast injection under fluoroscopy
- Digital subtraction angiography (DSA): Subtracts background; shows vessels only

**Common studies:**
- Peripheral angiography (PAD)
- Mesenteric angiography (GI bleeding, ischemia)
- Renal angiography (renovascular hypertension)
- Cerebral angiography (AVM, aneurysm)

### Embolization

**Principle:** Occlude blood flow to:
- Stop hemorrhage
- Devascularize tumor (preoperative or palliative)
- Treat AVM, fistula

**Embolization agents:**

| Agent | Properties | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Coils (platinum) | Permanent; large vessel occlusion | Pseudoaneurysm, hemorrhage |
| Particles (PVA, microspheres) | Permanent; variable size | Tumor embolization, UAE |
| Gelfoam | Temporary (resorbable) | GI hemorrhage, epistaxis |
| Glue (Histoacryl/NBCA) | Permanent; liquid | AVM, variceal |
| Onyx (EVOH) | Permanent; liquid; non-adhesive | AVM |

**Common embolization procedures:**
- **Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE):** UAE with microspheres; treats menorrhagia
- **Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE):** For BPH
- **Splenic embolization:** Hypersplenism; trauma (splenic artery pseudoaneurysm)
- **Gastrointestinal hemorrhage:** SMA/IMA branches; requires active bleeding
- **Hepatic embolization:** HCC palliation; TACE (transarterial chemoembolization)

### Angioplasty and Stenting

**Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA):**
- Balloon dilation of stenosed vessel
- Indications: Peripheral arterial disease, renal artery stenosis, SMA stenosis

**Stenting:**
- Metal stent deployed after angioplasty (for suboptimal result or recoil)
- Covered stents: For aortic aneurysm exclusion (EVAR/TEVAR)

**EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair):**
- Endograft excludes AAA from circulation
- Less invasive than open surgery
- Requires annual surveillance CT for endoleak

## 51.4 Image-Guided Biopsy

### Principles

**Tissue confirmation required for:**
- Suspected malignancy (before treatment)
- Uncertain diagnosis (e.g., solitary pulmonary nodule)
- Staging (lymph node sampling)

**Approach selection:**
- Shortest, safest path to lesion
- Avoid major vessels, bowel, pleura (where possible)
- Coaxial technique: Outer guide needle + inner biopsy needle

### CT-Guided Lung Biopsy

**Technique:**
- Patient prone or supine depending on lesion location
- CT fluoroscopy or intermittent CT guidance
- Core needle biopsy (18-gauge) — preferred; FNA where core not possible

**Complications:**
- Pneumothorax: 15-20% (most clinically significant require chest drain in ~5%)
- Hemorrhage: Usually self-limiting pulmonary hemorrhage
- Air embolism: Rare but serious

### Percutaneous Liver Biopsy

**Image-guided (ultrasound/CT):**
- Focal lesion biopsy: CT or US guided core biopsy
- Diffuse liver disease: US-guided or blind liver biopsy

**Complications:**
- Bleeding (subcapsular hematoma, hemobilia)
- Bile duct injury (avoid targeting subcapsular lesions)

### Musculoskeletal Biopsy

**Bone/soft tissue biopsy:**
- Plan approach to avoid contaminating tissue planes needed for surgery
- Core biopsy preferred (18-20 gauge)
- Involves surgical and orthopedic planning

## 51.5 Drainage Procedures

### Abscess Drainage

**Percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD):**
- Indications: Accessible collection; patient unsuitable for surgery
- Technique: Image-guided needle → wire → drain placement
- Catheter left in for continuous drainage; flushed regularly
- Success rate: 80-90% for simple abscesses

**Collections amenable to percutaneous drainage:**
- Intra-abdominal abscesses (diverticular, postoperative)
- Liver abscess (pyogenic; amebic rarely needs drainage)
- Perirenal/renal abscess
- Pelvic abscess

### Biliary Drainage

**Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC):**
- Needle through liver into bile duct under US/fluoroscopy
- Contrast injection → cholangiogram
- Drainage catheter placement if obstruction

**Indications:**
- Biliary obstruction not amenable to ERCP
- Hilar cholangiocarcinoma
- Post-surgical biliary complications

**External vs. internal-external drainage:**
- External: Drainage to bag only
- Internal-external: Spans obstruction; bile enters duodenum

### Nephrostomy

**Percutaneous Nephrostomy (PCN):**
- Direct puncture of renal collecting system under US guidance
- Indications: Obstructive uropathy; urinary diversion; pyonephrosis

**Technique:**
- Posterior caliceal approach (avoids major vessels)
- 18-gauge needle → wire → nephrostomy tube

## 51.6 Ablation

### Principles

**Thermal ablation destroys tumor in situ:**
- Heat (Radiofrequency Ablation/RFA; Microwave Ablation/MWA)
- Cold (Cryoablation)
- Irreversible electroporation (IRE — non-thermal)

### Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)

**Mechanism:** Alternating current → ionic friction → heat → coagulation necrosis (60-100°C)

**Indications:**
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): Lesions &lt;3 cm; bridging to transplant
- Colorectal liver metastases: Unresectable
- Renal cell carcinoma: Small tumors (&lt;4 cm); patient not surgical candidate
- Lung nodules: Early-stage NSCLC; colorectal mets
- Bone: Osteoid osteoma (near-100% cure rate); palliation of metastases

### Microwave Ablation (MWA)

**Advantages over RFA:**
- Faster ablation times
- Larger ablation zones
- Less susceptible to "heat sink" effect from large vessels

### Cryoablation

**Mechanism:** Argon gas → Joule-Thomson effect → freezing → ice ball formation → cell death at &lt;-40°C

**Advantages:**
- Visible ice ball on CT/US for real-time monitoring
- Less pain
- Used for kidney, prostate, soft tissue

## Key Points Summary

1. **Seldinger technique:** Needle → wire → catheter — basis for all vascular access

2. **EVAR:** Endovascular AAA repair; less invasive; requires follow-up CT surveillance for endoleak

3. **UFE (Uterine Fibroid Embolization):** Microspheres via uterine arteries; treats menorrhagia without surgery

4. **Pneumothorax** is the most common complication of CT-guided lung biopsy (~15-20%)

5. **Percutaneous abscess drainage:** Image-guided catheter drainage; 80-90% success rate

6. **RFA/MWA:** Thermal ablation for HCC, renal tumors, osteoid osteoma; curative intent for small lesions
