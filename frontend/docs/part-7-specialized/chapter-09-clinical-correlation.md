# Chapter 56: Clinical Correlation and Integration

## Learning Objectives

- Apply systematic imaging approach to common clinical presentations
- Integrate clinical information with imaging findings
- Demonstrate understanding of appropriate imaging in key clinical scenarios
- Demonstrate cross-system imaging correlation skills
- Prepare for clinical practice with a radiological mindset

---

## 56.1 The Art of Clinical Correlation

### Why Clinical Correlation Matters

Radiology does not exist in isolation. The same image finding can have completely different significance depending on:

- **Clinical context:** Age, sex, history, symptoms
- **Timing:** Acute vs. chronic presentation
- **Prior imaging:** Change from previous studies
- **Laboratory data:** Inflammatory markers, tumor markers
- **Treatment history:** Prior surgery, chemotherapy, radiation

**"The best contrast agent is a good clinical history."**

### The Radiologist's Approach

**Systematic approach:**
1. Read the clinical question carefully before looking at images
2. Confirm patient identity and examination
3. Check technical adequacy
4. Compare with prior studies
5. Perform a systematic survey of the entire image set
6. Correlate findings with clinical history
7. Generate a differential diagnosis
8. Recommend next steps

## 56.2 Common Clinical Presentations — Imaging Integration

### Chest Pain

**Differential and imaging pathway:**

| Cause | First-Line Imaging | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Acute MI | Mainly ECG/troponin; CXR for complications | CXR: Pulmonary edema if heart failure |
| Pulmonary embolism | CTPA | Filling defect in pulmonary artery |
| Aortic dissection | CT Aortography | Intimal flap; true/false lumen |
| Pneumothorax | CXR | Visceral pleural line; absent lung markings |
| Pericardial effusion/tamponade | US (echo) | Pericardial effusion; tamponade physiology |
| Musculoskeletal | CXR to exclude serious cause | Normal |

**Triple rule-out CT:** Simultaneous evaluation for PE, dissection, and coronary artery disease (select patients)

### Headache

**Red flags requiring imaging:**
- "Thunderclap" (worst headache of life): Subarachnoid hemorrhage (CT + LP)
- Focal neurology
- Progressive headache in cancer patient
- Immunocompromised (opportunistic CNS infection)
- Papilledema (raised ICP)
- New headache >50 years

**Imaging pathway:**
- CT head (non-contrast): Acute hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, mass
- CT angiogram: Aneurysm if SAH suspected
- MRI brain + contrast: Tumor, abscess, encephalitis, meningitis
- LP: If CT normal + SAH suspected (xanthochromia)

### Dyspnea / Shortness of Breath

| Cause | CXR Findings | Additional |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Heart failure | Cardiomegaly; pulmonary edema; effusions; Kerley B | Echo; BNP |
| Pneumonia | Consolidation | Clinical + bloods |
| COPD exacerbation | Hyperinflation; flat diaphragm | Spirometry |
| Pulmonary embolism | Normal or Hampton's hump | CTPA |
| Pneumothorax | Pleural line; mediastinal shift | CXR diagnostic |
| Pleural effusion | Opacification; blunted CP angle | US; diagnostic tap |

### Abdominal Pain

**Right upper quadrant pain:**
- Cholecystitis: US (gallstones, thickened wall, pericholecystic fluid, Murphy's sign)
- Choledocholithiasis: US + MRCP
- Hepatitis: US first; CT/MRI for complications

**Right iliac fossa pain:**
- Appendicitis: US first; CT if US equivocal
- Ovarian pathology (women): US (torsion, ectopic)
- Crohn's disease: CT/MRI enterography

**Left iliac fossa pain:**
- Diverticulitis: CT with contrast
- Bowel obstruction: CT
- Left ovarian (women): US

**Generalized/diffuse:**
- Bowel obstruction: AXR + CT
- Mesenteric ischemia: CTA
- Peritonitis (free air): Erect CXR; CT

### Back Pain

**Urgent ("red flags"):**
- Neurological symptoms → MRI spine
- Cancer history → MRI whole spine
- Fever + back pain → MRI spine (epidural abscess, discitis)
- Cauda equina → Emergency MRI lumbar spine

**Non-urgent:**
- Acute simple mechanical: No imaging initially (within 6 weeks)
- Persistent >6 weeks: X-ray then MRI
- Degenerative: MRI for disc herniation; CT for bony detail

## 56.3 Cross-System Integration Cases

### Case Approach 1: Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO)

**Definition:** Temp >38.3°C on multiple occasions; >3 weeks duration; no diagnosis after initial workup

**Imaging role:**
1. CXR: Pulmonary infection, malignancy
2. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Lymphadenopathy, abscess, mass, splenic lesions
3. FDG PET-CT: High sensitivity for metabolically active foci (infection, malignancy, vasculitis)
4. Echocardiography: Endocarditis vegetation
5. Tagged WBC scan: Localize occult infection

### Case Approach 2: New Lung Mass

**Step 1:** Characterize on CT:
- Size, location, margins, density
- Contrast enhancement
- Associated findings (lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion)

**Step 2:** Stage:
- PET-CT: Mediastinal nodes, distant metastases
- Brain MRI: Brain metastases (if lung cancer confirmed)

**Step 3:** Biopsy/tissue diagnosis:
- CT-guided biopsy (peripheral)
- Bronchoscopy (central)
- EBUS (endobronchial US for mediastinal nodes)

**Step 4:** Multidisciplinary team discussion

### Case Approach 3: Stroke-Like Presentation

**Acute setting (&lt;4.5 hours):**
1. Non-contrast CT (exclude hemorrhage — 5 minutes)
2. CT Angiography (LVO detection — 5 minutes)
3. CT Perfusion (core/penumbra, guide thrombectomy decision)
4. Treatment: tPA if eligible; thrombectomy if LVO

**Subacute (&gt;24 hours):**
- MRI DWI/FLAIR: Confirm infarct territory
- MRA intracranial: Residual stenosis
- Carotid duplex/CTA neck: Carotid stenosis
- Echo: Cardiac source (AF, PFO)

### Case Approach 4: Bone Pain in Cancer Patient

**Suspected bone metastases:**
1. Bone scan: Highly sensitive (especially osteoblastic)
2. PET-CT: Superior for osteolytic mets (e.g., renal, thyroid, myeloma)
3. Targeted X-ray: Confirm suspicious site; fracture risk
4. MRI: Spinal involvement; cord compression risk
5. CT: Measure lesion size; plan RT; assess fracture risk

**Pathological fracture:**
- Fracture through abnormal bone (metastasis, primary tumor, Paget's)
- Transverse fracture through lytic lesion
- MRI to characterize if uncertain

## 56.4 Imaging Quality and Safety Review

### When Imaging Is NOT Appropriate

**Avoid imaging when:**
- Findings will not change management
- Alternative diagnosis much more likely (clinical diagnosis sufficient)
- Patient will not tolerate procedure
- Radiation risk outweighs benefit (especially in young/pregnant patients)

**ACR Appropriateness Criteria:**
- Evidence-based guidance for appropriate imaging
- Rates imaging as "usually appropriate," "may be appropriate," "usually not appropriate"

### Follow-Up Imaging Principles

**Incidental findings — when to follow up:**
- Follow the latest society guidelines (Fleischner, ACR, etc.)
- Document findings clearly so follow-up is not lost
- Consider patient risk factors (smoking, immunosuppression)

**Treatment response imaging:**
- RECIST criteria: Standard for solid tumor response
  - Complete response: All lesions disappeared
  - Partial response: ≥30% reduction in sum of diameters
  - Progressive disease: ≥20% increase or new lesion
  - Stable disease: Between PR and PD

## Key Points for Clinical Practice

1. **Clinical context first** — the same finding has different significance in different patients; always integrate imaging with clinical information

2. **Systematic search pattern** — never look for one thing; survey the entire image before focusing on abnormalities

3. **"Don't miss" findings** — pneumothorax, free air, aortic dissection, cord compression — always specifically exclude on every relevant study

4. **Appropriate imaging** — balance diagnostic benefit against radiation, cost, and availability; follow ACR Appropriateness Criteria

5. **Communication** — a brilliant radiological diagnosis is useless if not communicated clearly and promptly to the clinical team

6. **Lifelong learning** — radiology evolves rapidly; AI, new modalities, and updated guidelines require ongoing education
