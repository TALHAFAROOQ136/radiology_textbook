## 50.1 Major Trauma Imaging

### Primary Survey and Imaging

**ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) imaging protocol:**
1. Chest X-ray (portable in trauma bay)
2. Pelvic X-ray (portable)
3. Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST)
4. CT — if patient is hemodynamically stable

### Whole-Body CT (WBCT) in Major Trauma

**"Trauma pan-scan":**
- CT head, CT cervical spine, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast
- Rapid assessment of all injuries
- Most efficient in major blunt trauma
- Standard: Arterial phase for vascular injuries + portal venous phase

**When NOT to do WBCT:**
- Hemodynamically unstable → go to OR/IR without delay
- Minor mechanism → targeted imaging only

### FAST Exam

**Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma:**
Looks for FREE FLUID (blood) in 4 windows:

| Window | Location |
|--------|---------|
| Right upper quadrant (RUQ) | Morison's pouch (hepatorenal space) |
| Left upper quadrant (LUQ) | Perisplenic space (splenorenal) |
| Suprapubic | Pelvis/pouch of Douglas |
| Subxiphoid/Pericardial | Pericardial effusion/tamponade |

**Extended FAST (eFAST):**
- Adds bilateral pleural windows for pneumothorax and hemothorax

**FAST limitations:**
- Cannot detect solid organ injury without hemoperitoneum
- Operator dependent
- Cannot assess retroperitoneal injuries
- Negative FAST does NOT exclude intra-abdominal injury

---

## 50.2 Chest Emergencies

### Aortic Injury

**Traumatic aortic injury (TAI):**
- Mechanism: Deceleration (MVA, falls)
- Most common site: Aortic isthmus (just distal to left subclavian artery)

**CXR findings suggesting aortic injury:**
- Mediastinal widening (>8 cm at aortic knob level)
- Obscured aortic knob
- Left apical cap (pleural blood)
- Tracheal deviation to right
- Depression of left main bronchus
- Nasogastric tube deviation right

**CT Aortography (CTA) is definitive:**
- Pseudoaneurysm, intimal flap, periaortic hematoma
- Manages repair planning

### Pneumothorax (Tension)

**Tension pneumothorax:** CLINICAL EMERGENCY — do not wait for X-ray

**CXR features:**
- Tracheal deviation AWAY from affected side
- Mediastinal shift
- Complete lung collapse
- Diaphragm depression
- Absent lung markings

**Simple pneumothorax:**
- Thin pleural line with absent markings beyond
- Deep sulcus sign on supine film (air collects anteriorly)

### Hemothorax

**Imaging:**
- CXR: Opacification of hemithorax; blunted costophrenic angle
- CT: Hyperdense fluid (blood) in pleural space
- Massive: >1500 mL blood loss

## 50.3 Abdominal Emergencies

### Acute Aortic Syndromes

**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) — Rupture:**
- Clinical triad: Pain + pulsatile mass + hypotension
- CT: Periaortic hematoma; extravasation of contrast
- Emergency: Endovascular (EVAR) or open repair

**CT findings:**
- Aortic diameter >3 cm = aneurysm; >5.5 cm = repair threshold
- Active bleeding: "Blush" of IV contrast outside aorta
- Retroperitoneal hematoma

### Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

**Clinical:** Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to exam; elderly; AF

**CT Angiography:**
- **Arterial occlusion (SMA):** Absent enhancement; thrombus in SMA
- **Venous thrombosis (SMV):** Hyperdense thrombus in SMV; edematous loops
- **Non-occlusive (NOMI):** Vasoconstriction; low flow state

**Bowel findings:**
- Pneumatosis intestinalis (air in bowel wall) — ischemia/necrosis
- Portal venous gas — advanced ischemia/infarction
- Absent bowel wall enhancement

### Bowel Obstruction

**Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO):**
- CXR: Multiple air-fluid levels; dilated loops; absent rectal gas
- CT: Transition point; proximal dilation + distal collapse
- Causes: Adhesions (most common), hernias, tumor

**Closed Loop Obstruction:**
- Both ends of a loop obstructed → URGENT
- CT: C-shaped or U-shaped dilated loop; "whirl sign" (mesenteric twisting)
- High risk of strangulation and necrosis

**Volvulus:**
- Sigmoid volvulus: Inverted U "coffee bean" sign; massive dilation
- Cecal volvulus: Displaced cecum to left upper quadrant
- Gastric volvulus: Rare; diaphragm herniation

### Appendicitis

**CT (standard in adults):**
- Dilated appendix (>6 mm outer diameter)
- Appendicolith (calcified fecalith)
- Periappendiceal fat stranding
- Appendiceal wall thickening/enhancement

**Perforated appendicitis:**
- Extraluminal gas
- Periappendiceal abscess
- Free fluid/pus throughout abdomen

### Diverticulitis

**CT findings:**
- Pericolic fat stranding around sigmoid colon
- Thickened bowel wall
- Diverticula identified
- Complications: Abscess, fistula, free perforation (free gas + peritonitis)

**Hinchey Classification:**
- I: Pericolic abscess
- II: Pelvic/distant abscess
- III: Purulent peritonitis (generalized)
- IV: Fecal peritonitis

## 50.4 Genitourinary Emergencies

### Renal Colic (Urolithiasis)

**CT KUB (Non-contrast CT):**
- Gold standard for acute renal colic
- Detects stones, size, location, obstruction
- "Soft tissue rim sign": Soft tissue rim around stone in ureter (distinguishes from phlebolith)
- Secondary signs: Perinephric stranding, hydroureteronephrosis, renal enlargement

**Stone composition on CT:**
- Calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate: Most common; dense (HU 400-600)
- Uric acid: Radiolucent on X-ray; visible on CT (HU 100-300)
- Struvite, cystine: Variable

### Testicular Torsion

**EMERGENCY — imaging must not delay treatment**

**Ultrasound with Doppler:**
- Absent or reduced intratesticular blood flow (on affected side)
- Normal or increased flow on unaffected side
- "Torsion twist" sign: Twisted spermatic cord
- Swollen, heterogeneous testis

**Time is testis:** Surgical exploration within 6 hours = 90% salvage

### Ovarian Torsion

**Ultrasound:**
- Enlarged ovary (>4 cm) with multiple peripheral follicles
- "String of beads" appearance
- Absent or reduced ovarian blood flow on Doppler
- Free fluid
- **Note:** Present flow does NOT exclude torsion (intermittent torsion)

## 50.5 Neurological Emergencies

### Stroke — Rapid Imaging Protocol

**Non-contrast CT:** First line (exclude hemorrhage)
**CT Angiography:** Large vessel occlusion for thrombectomy
**CT Perfusion:** Core vs. penumbra (salvageable tissue)
**MRI DWI:** Most sensitive for early infarction

**Door-to-CT target:** &lt;25 minutes
**Door-to-needle (tPA):** &lt;60 minutes
**Door-to-groin (thrombectomy):** &lt;90 minutes

### Spinal Cord Emergencies

**Urgent MRI spine within &lt;24 hours for:**
- Cauda equina syndrome
- Acute myelopathy
- Suspected MSCC (metastatic spinal cord compression)
- Epidural abscess

---

## 50.6 Vascular Emergencies

### Pulmonary Embolism

**CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):**
- Gold standard for PE diagnosis
- Filling defect in pulmonary artery
- Central PE: Saddle PE; main pulmonary artery
- "Hampton's hump": Wedge-shaped pleural-based infarction on CXR

**CT right heart strain signs:**
- RV/LV ratio >0.9 (measured at RV/LV widest point)
- Interventricular septum flattening (D-shape)
- Contrast reflux into IVC/hepatic veins

**Modified Wells Score** for pretest probability before CTPA

### Aortic Dissection

**Classification:**
- Type A: Involves ascending aorta → SURGICAL EMERGENCY
- Type B: Descending only → Medical management (unless complications)

**CT Aortography:**
- Intimal flap separating true and false lumens
- True lumen: Smaller, higher density, earlier contrast
- False lumen: Larger, lower density, delayed/no contrast
- Complications: Malperfusion of kidneys, bowel, legs

## Key Points Summary

1. **FAST exam** — identifies free fluid in trauma; eFAST adds pneumothorax windows; does NOT exclude solid organ injury

2. **Mediastinal widening on trauma CXR** — suggests aortic injury; CTA aortography is definitive

3. **Closed loop obstruction** — both ends occluded; risk of strangulation; "whirl sign" on CT

4. **Pneumatosis intestinalis + portal gas** — ischemic bowel necrosis; surgical emergency

5. **Testicular torsion** — absent intratesticular flow on Doppler; surgery within 6 hours

6. **Type A dissection** — involves ascending aorta; immediate surgery; Type B → medical management
