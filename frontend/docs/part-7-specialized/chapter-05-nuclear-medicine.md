## 52.1 Principles of Nuclear Medicine

### Basic Concepts

**Nuclear medicine** uses radioactive tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) that emit gamma rays, detected by gamma cameras.

**Radiopharmaceutical components:**
- **Radionuclide:** Radioactive atom (emits gamma rays)
- **Pharmaceutical:** Carrier molecule that delivers radionuclide to target tissue

**Common radionuclides:**

| Radionuclide | Half-Life | Use |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) | 6 hours | Most common; bone, thyroid, HIDA, lung |
| Iodine-131 (I-131) | 8 days | Thyroid treatment + imaging |
| Iodine-123 (I-123) | 13 hours | Thyroid imaging |
| Fluorine-18 (F-18) | 110 min | PET scanning (FDG) |
| Thallium-201 (Tl-201) | 73 hours | Cardiac stress testing (legacy) |
| Gallium-67 (Ga-67) | 78 hours | Infection, lymphoma (legacy) |

### Imaging Principles

**Planar scintigraphy:** 2D image from single or multiple views

**SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography):**
- 3D acquisition from rotating gamma camera
- Better anatomic localization than planar
- Examples: SPECT bone scan, myocardial perfusion

**PET (Positron Emission Tomography):**
- F-18 FDG emits positron → annihilation with electron → 2 gamma rays 180° apart
- Coincidence detection → 3D image of metabolic activity
- Always combined with CT (PET-CT) for anatomic correlation

## 52.2 Bone Scintigraphy

### Principle

**Tc-99m MDP (methylene diphosphonate):**
- Incorporated into hydroxyapatite in areas of bone turnover
- High uptake = increased osteoblastic activity
- Whole body bone scan: 3 hours after injection

### Indications

- **Metastatic bone disease:** Highly sensitive (especially osteoblastic mets)
- **Occult fractures:** Stress fractures, insufficiency fractures
- **Osteomyelitis:** 3-phase bone scan
- **Avascular necrosis (AVN):** Cold area (early); hot area (revascularization)
- **Paget's disease:** Intense focal uptake

### Normal vs. Abnormal Uptake

**Normal:** Uniform uptake; slightly higher in joints, spine, skull

**Increased uptake (hot spots):**
- Metastases (most common cause of multiple hot spots)
- Fractures
- Arthritis
- Paget's disease
- Osteomyelitis

**Decreased uptake (cold spots):**
- Early AVN (ischemia)
- Multiple myeloma (osteolytic — may be COLD on bone scan)
- Aggressive metastases

**Super scan:**
- Uniformly increased uptake throughout skeleton
- Reduced renal/soft tissue activity
- Causes: Widespread bone metastases; hyperparathyroidism

### Three-Phase Bone Scan (Osteomyelitis)

| Phase | Timing | Measures |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Flow phase | Dynamic during injection | Blood flow (perfusion) |
| Blood pool | Immediately after | Soft tissue hyperemia |
| Delayed | 3-4 hours | Bone turnover |

**Osteomyelitis pattern:** Increased in all 3 phases
**Cellulitis:** Increased in phases 1 and 2; normal phase 3

## 52.3 PET-CT (FDG PET)

### Principle

**FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose):**
- Glucose analogue taken up by metabolically active cells
- Malignant cells: High glucose metabolism → high FDG uptake
- Uptake measured as SUV (Standardized Uptake Value)
- SUVmax: Maximum value in region; >2.5 suspicious for malignancy

### Normal FDG Distribution

**Normally high uptake:**
- Brain (glucose-dependent)
- Heart (variable — fasting reduces uptake)
- Liver (diffuse moderate)
- Kidneys and bladder (FDG excreted in urine)

**Important pitfalls:**
- Brown adipose tissue: High uptake in neck/paravertebral (not malignant)
- Physiologic bowel uptake: Variable
- Inflammation: Infection, post-treatment, inflammatory disease

### Clinical Indications for FDG PET-CT

**Oncology (primary use):**

| Cancer | Role |
|--------|------|
| Lung cancer | Staging; mediastinal LN; distant mets |
| Lymphoma (Hodgkin/NHL) | Staging; therapy response; Deauville score |
| Melanoma | Staging; recurrence |
| Colorectal | Restaging; recurrence |
| Head and neck | Unknown primary; staging |
| Esophageal | Staging |

**Treatment response:**
- Deauville score (lymphoma): 1-5 scale based on FDG uptake vs. mediastinum/liver
- Score 1-3: Complete metabolic response
- Score 4-5: Residual disease

**Non-oncology:**
- Fever of unknown origin (FUO)
- Cardiac sarcoidosis
- Infective endocarditis (prosthetic valve)
- Large vessel vasculitis (PET/MRI)
- Dementia (amyloid PET — emerging)

## 52.4 Thyroid Imaging

### Thyroid Scintigraphy

**Tc-99m pertechnetate or I-123:**
- Trapped by thyroid (like iodine)
- I-123: Better image quality for thyroid

**Normal thyroid:** Butterfly-shaped uptake in neck

**Thyroid nodule evaluation:**
- **Hot nodule** (increased uptake): Functioning (toxic) adenoma; malignancy rare
- **Cold nodule** (decreased uptake): Decreased function; 10-15% risk of malignancy
- **Warm nodule:** Same uptake as surrounding thyroid; indeterminate

**Whole body I-131 scan:**
- Post-thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer
- Detect residual thyroid tissue or metastases
- Requires thyroid stimulating conditions (hypothyroidism or rhTSH)

### I-131 Therapy

**Indications:**
- Graves' disease (hyperthyroidism)
- Toxic multinodular goiter
- Differentiated thyroid cancer (post-thyroidectomy ablation)

**Radiation safety:** Patient requires isolation; avoid pregnancy

## 52.5 Cardiac Nuclear Medicine

### Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI)

**Radiotracers:** Tc-99m sestamibi/tetrofosmin (SPECT); Rb-82 or N-13 ammonia (PET)

**Protocol:**
- Stress (exercise or pharmacological) + rest images
- Pharmacological stress: Adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson

**Interpretation:**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Normal perfusion (stress and rest) | No significant CAD |
| Reversible defect (abnormal stress, normal rest) | Ischemia (viable myocardium) |
| Fixed defect (abnormal stress AND rest) | Infarction (scar) |
| Reverse redistribution | Artifact or reperfused territory |

**Viability assessment:**
- Fixed defect + FDG uptake (PET): Viable hibernating myocardium (benefit from revascularization)
- Fixed defect + no FDG: Scar (no benefit from revascularization)

## 52.6 Other Nuclear Medicine Studies

### Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan

**Indications:** Pulmonary embolism when CT contraindicated (renal failure, contrast allergy, pregnancy)

**Interpretation (PIOPED criteria):**
- Normal V/Q: Excludes PE
- High probability: Unmatched perfusion defect (normal V, abnormal Q) = PE until proven otherwise
- Intermediate: Indeterminate; requires further workup
- Low probability: Not completely reassuring if clinical probability high

### Hepatobiliary (HIDA) Scan

**Tc-99m IDA compounds:** Excreted by hepatocytes into bile

**Uses:**
- Acute cholecystitis: Non-visualization of gallbladder at 4 hours = positive (obstruction of cystic duct)
- Biliary leak: Post-surgical biliary leak
- Biliary atresia in neonates

### Renal Scintigraphy

**MAG3 or DTPA scan:**
- Differential renal function (split function)
- Obstruction: Diuresis renogram; delayed washout with obstruction
- Renovascular hypertension: Captopril renogram

### Parathyroid Scintigraphy

**Tc-99m sestamibi + SPECT:**
- Localizes parathyroid adenoma preoperatively
- High uptake in adenoma (high mitochondrial content)
- Dual-phase: Early (thyroid + parathyroid) and delayed (thyroid washes out; adenoma persists)

## Key Points Summary

1. **Tc-99m** most common radionuclide; 6-hour half-life; bone scans, HIDA, thyroid

2. **FDG PET-CT:** Metabolic imaging; SUVmax >2.5 suspicious; staging lung cancer, lymphoma

3. **Bone scan:** Highly sensitive for metastases; cold on myeloma; super scan = widespread disease

4. **V/Q scan:** Use when CTPA contraindicated; unmatched defect = high probability PE

5. **HIDA scan:** Acute cholecystitis = non-visualization of GB at 4 hours

6. **Myocardial perfusion:** Reversible defect = ischemia; fixed defect = scar/infarction
