# Understanding DICOM Standards in Modern Radiology

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images enabling the integration of medical imaging devices such as scanners, servers, workstations, printers, network hardware, and media storage devices from multiple manufacturers.

## Key Components of DICOM

- **File Format**: Standardized format for medical images
- **Network Protocol**: Communication protocol for transferring images
- **Directory Structure**: Organization of related images
- **Metadata**: Patient and study information

## Importance in Medical Imaging

DICOM ensures interoperability between different medical imaging systems, allowing healthcare providers to share patient images seamlessly across different platforms and institutions.
