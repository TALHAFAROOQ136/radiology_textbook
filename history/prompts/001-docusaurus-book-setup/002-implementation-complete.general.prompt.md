2. **Frontend Platform**: Docusaurus-based educational platform with 7-part textbook structure covering all radiology fundamentals
3. **Database Layer**: Neon Postgres with comprehensive data models and relationships
4. **Authentication System**: Secure user registration, login, and profile management
5. **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker configuration, and nginx reverse proxy
6. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, logging, monitoring, accessibility, and security measures
7. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, CDN configuration, and load testing capabilities

The platform is now fully functional with all planned features implemented and is ready for deployment. Created comprehensive test suites, performance benchmarks, and all necessary configuration files for production deployment.
