# PHR: Foundations Medical Imaging Tasks

## Summary
Created comprehensive task breakdown for Part I: Foundations of Medical Imaging with 5 phases, 132 specific tasks organized by user story priority, complete with dependencies and parallel execution examples.

## Details
- **Feature**: Part I - Foundations of Medical Imaging
- **Branch**: 001-foundations-imaging
- **Description**: Task breakdown for implementing the first 5 foundational chapters of the radiology textbook
- **Status**: Ready for implementation

## Files Created
- specs/001-foundations-imaging/tasks.md

## Task Breakdown Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 132
- **Setup Phase**: 7 tasks (project initialization)
- **Foundational Phase**: 16 tasks (database, models, infrastructure)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 19 tasks (access foundational content)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: 13 tasks (radiation safety principles)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: 11 tasks (imaging physics fundamentals)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: 9 tasks (contrast agents)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: 7 tasks (appropriateness criteria)
